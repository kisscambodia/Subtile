4
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,630
Shut the gate if the pipe broke.

5
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,030
Why are you covering it with hands?

6
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,470
What if the metal pipe broke?

7
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,060
You would've broken your hands.

8
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,590
Mr Zhou Chuan?

9
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,470
Put the clothes on first.

10
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,860
What's the matter with you?

11
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,310
Why did you return all of a sudden?

12
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,670
This is my house.

13
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,180
Can't I come back?

14
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,870
I haven't asked you.

15
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,509
What did you do to my pipe?

16
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,710
Perhaps it's broken due to

17
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,900
your sudden return.

18
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,630
Really?

19
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,710
And maybe it's because

20
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,390
I patted it lightly.

21
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,710
Patted it lightly?

22
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,310
Which rainforest

23
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,460
are you from, King Kong?

24
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,350
Pretending to be a monkey
and destroy my house.

25
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,670
Didn't you say

26
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,030
you'll be back in several days?

27
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,870
Is this the reason

28
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,430
you ran around with your pyjamas

29
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,430
and turned my bathroom into
Waterfall Cave?

30
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,790
You... You saw it?

31
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,150
I'm not blind.

32
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,310
Stop covering!

33
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,950
You'll smother yourself!

34
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,100
Where's your manners?

35
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:56,230
Look people in the eye
when they're talking to you.

36
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,350
I've seen it all anyway.

37
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,790
Just smother yourself.

38
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,950
Why are you being reasonable

39
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,310
now that you've seen it?

40
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,100
Why can't I look
if you dare to wear it?

41
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,550
I'm going back to the room and sleep.

42
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,310
Just say I'm not around

43
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,110
if someone looks for me.

44
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,190
Tell them you don't know where I went.

45
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,980
Especially if it's my father
and Jiang Yu Cheng.

46
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,430
Hold on!

47
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,430
You haven't told me

48
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,910
why you came back all of a sudden.

49
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,110
Is it because you had a fight
with your family

50
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,750
or with Mr Jiang?

51

The 30th rule of the tenancy rules.

52
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,030
All right, I'll stop asking.

53
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,670
From my experience,

54
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,990
your father must be in a bad mood.

55
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,070
Hello.

56
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,910
Hello, Mr Jiang.

57
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,620
Why do you call me at this hour?

58
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,550
Mr Jiang, I'd like to ask you.

59
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,900
What happened to Mr Zhou Chuan?

60
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,350
He looked upset

61
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,110
when he came back just now.

62
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,750
[He seemed to have quarrelled with
his family this afternoon.]

63
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,190
We planned to have dinner tonight

64
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:18,910
but he didn't come too.

65
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,910
As I expected.

66
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,350
But how did you know he went back?

67
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,230
Isn't there a location feature
in the chat software?

68
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,230
[Perhaps when we were having
conversation just now,]

69

the distance between us

70
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,990
was shortened by dozen kilometres.

71
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,910
Is there such a function?

72
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,630
Yes.

73
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,230
It's getting late.

74
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,990
Get some rest.

75
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,460
I'll stop bothering you.

are hard to communicate

and always rush her
to submit the drafts.

86

She said we even find fault with
her drafts after handing them in

87
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,510

with rejection.

You

92
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,270
can mess things up even by just

[Book of Luo He God]

Doesn't it have an overbearing impact

in comparison to those books
in the same genre?

103

[Book of Luo He God]

104
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,830
An overbearing impact.

105

I'm sorry.

106
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,230
It's hard for me to admire

107
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,070
your poor aesthete's taste.

108
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,630
Just explain it to me.

109
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,909
We can follow the trend.

110
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,790
This is a type of mindset.

111
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,500
Everyone is wondering

112
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,790
if Yuan Yue Publishing House
could create something unique.

113
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,909
No one has ever

114
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:02,030
used this traditional ink and
calligraphy as the cover.

115
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,150
It's outdated.

116
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,230
That's why no one use it.

117
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,550
It's not outdated. Why is it outdated?

118
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,870
If we only use it

119
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,230
as couplets on the cover,

120
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,870
that will be boring

121
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,390
and outdated for sure.

122
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,710
But if we use a kind of

123
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,350
special display technique,

124
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,550
then this calligraphy
can be cool as well.

125
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,670
Then have you thought about

126
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,340
the reason why you want to
use illustrations as the book cover?

127
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,270
I've thought about it.

128
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,390
It's because many readers think

129
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,940
that would fulfil their fantasy

130
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,820
if their imaginary characters

131
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,460
appear vividly on the illustrations.

132
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,510
Right.

133
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,030
Then why do you want to
break their illusion?

134
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,350
Don't you think it's cruel?

135
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,940
I'm not trying to break their illusion.

136
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,630
I just want to try
a different display technique.

137
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,020
For example, we can

138
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,780
use this calligraphy on the cover

139
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,110
and use hollow technique

140
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,750
to vaguely reveal the illustration inside.

141
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,590
It will be more
attractive with this way.

142
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,550
And it can fulfil
the readers' fantasy as well.

143
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,470
Are you here to apologise?

144
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,670
But it's too late.

145
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,300
I just went to the legal department.

146
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,950
This is the termination agreement
they drafted.

147
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,460
If you're furious with
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

148
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,950
we'll agree to terminate the agreement.

149
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,910
But we will not return the drafts

150
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,150
and we own the use-right.

151
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,230
You still have to pay us twice the fine.

152
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,590
You guys were the one to spite me

153
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,230
and you still have
the audacity to fine me?

154
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,630
Who's the one that
refused to communicate

155
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,070
and violated the contract?

156
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,670
You knew it well.

157
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,270
Do you want me to

158
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,230
remind you with the chat histories?

159
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,030
I didn't hold you to account

160
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,309
because Yuan Yue Publishing House
is a big company.

161
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,990
We don't want to waste time

162
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,110
to deal with an ordinary illustrator

163
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,660
because of some trivial matters.

164
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,630
That will dishonour

165
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,510
Yuan Yue Publishing House
and Mr Zhou Chuan.

166
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,870
Who are you scolding?

167
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,950
But it's different now.

168
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,510
You're complaining around.

169
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,310
You assaulted me

170
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,790
in every illustrator group
with your illustration.

171
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,860
Have you forgotten
the privacy terms in the contract?

172
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,950
For this reason alone,

173
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,430
I can legitimately terminate
the agreement.

174
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,750
If you did that,

175
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,950
no illustrator will be willing
to cooperate with you.

176
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,180
You don't have to care about that.

177
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,990
Mr Xia

178
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,470
has invited a famous calligrapher

179
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,550
to write an epigraph for
Mr Zhou Chuan's book.

180
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,910
I can't believe you'll use

181
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,300
calligraphy as the cover.

182
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,630
This is our official account.

183
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,870
It has been forwarded over

184
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,660
ten thousand times in a short time.

185
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,230
The readers are cheering
in the comments.

186
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,190
They said the cooperation between
Zhou Chuan and Yuan Yue Publishing House

187
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,310
is a transboundary between
emerging art and traditional art.

188
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,780
Terminating the agreement

189
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,870
won't affect us in such situation.

190
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,950
But it's different for you.

191
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,350
Soon, everyone will say that

192
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,070
we terminate your agreement

193
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,460
is due to your terrible work.

194
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,100
Tell me.

195
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,030
What do you want?

196
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,790
The second plan is

197
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,670
your drafts won't be rejected.

198
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,190
Let bygones be bygones

199
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,350
but you have to sign
a complementary agreement

200
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,750
to agree that your illustrations

201
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,790
can only be used
in the poster or inside cover.

202
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,630
Only inside cover?

203
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,510
Think about it.

204
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,220
I'll leave first as I'm busy.

205
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,590
There's a truth that
I always wanted to tell you.

206
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,900
Your ability is outstanding.

207
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,750
But I was young and ignorant

208
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,030
to like you.

209
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,630
Director Gu, it's me.

210
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,230
Director Gu,

211
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,470
what should I do?
You have to help me.

212
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,270
This is quite a major controversy.

213
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,230
Director Gu, I

214
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,830
didn't meet the deadline

215
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,790
because of you.

216
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,790
I just asked you for
the cover of Yun Fei.

217
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,780
You can't complete the job you took

218
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,350
and now you're blaming it on me.

219
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,310
It won't do me any good
if you screw up.

220
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,310
I have ways to give us an out.

221
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,070
I'll do anything you want.

222
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,910
Chu Li,

223
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,510
look, Cocoon just issued a statement.

224
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,780
She said people got the wrong idea.

225
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,910
"It has nothing to do with
the editor of Yuan Yue Publishing House."

226
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,870
"I worked well with
Yuan Yue Publishing House."

227
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,430
"We even had coffee
together this afternoon

228
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,780
and discuss about
Mr Zhou Chuan's new book."

229
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,190
She even posted the photo of the cafe.

230
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,270
It's really hard for her.

231
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,710
I guess her heart was bleeding

232
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,670
when she wrote these words.

233
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,670
[Sorry,]

Mr Xia.

241
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,830
This cover

242
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,100
is interesting. Look.

243
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,110
Monochrome calligraphy
is eye-catching

244

[Book of Luo He God, Zhou Chuan]

245
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,630
and Cocoon's colourful drawing

246
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,510
can be seen vaguely.

247
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,590
It's the combination
of modern and traditional.

248
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,950
I'm very satisfied.

249
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,910
This is my idea

250
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,270
but it's designed by Ah Xiang.

251
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,390
You've done a great job
in such a short time.

252
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,510
Ah Xiang,

253
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,310
I think

254
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,390
you're as good as Cocoon.

255
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,310
Youngster like you
should express yourself more.

256
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,310
Don't always hide in the back.

257
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,350
Okay, the design of this cover

258
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,230
will be settled once it's completed.

259
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,950
The next step is to collaborate with

260
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,710
the circulation department
in publicizing it.

261
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,550
Right, Chu Li.

262
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,070
I heard that you assured Miao and Liang

263
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,310
that you can reach the sales volume
of 350,000 for the book?

264
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,470
All right.

265
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,430
That's brave.

266
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,550
But you have to walk the talk.

267
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,710
I'll try my best, Mr Xia.

268
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,390
Oh my god!

269
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,140
Is Mr Zhou Chuan
experiencing depression?

270
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,830

272
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,900
Mr Zhou, what do you want
to have for dinner?

273
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,270
I don't want to eat.

274
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,540
Dinner is on the dining table.

275
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,300
Remember to eat it when you come out.

276
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,190
Mr Zhou, I've taken care
of Cocoon's cover.

277
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,750
You don't have to worry.

Open your door.

283

I can't hear you with the door closed.

I said what...

285
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,870
Why don't you get up?

286
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,830
It's improper for man and
woman to be too intimate.

287
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,350
What does that mean?

294

how long do you plan
to lock yourself?

295
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,150
You don't even update
your article on the internet.

296
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,230
The readers thought you went missing.

297
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,670
Do you know that cause for concern?

298
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,310
What's going on?

299
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,110
Why do you take it on all by yourself?

300
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,900
Why is your face

301
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,870
so big?

302
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,870
Right, right.

303
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,870
I know I'm a freeloader.

304
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,870
And I bother you
with the matter of publication.

305
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,150
It's true that I am bold.

306
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,180
But we live under the same roof after all.

307
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,390
We are not friends

308
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,790
but we are more than
just a nodding acquaintance.

309
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,869
I'll ask you even if you think

310
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:10,829
that I'm nosy.

311
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,990
What happened when you were
in your hometown?

312
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,710
What's with all those emotions?

313
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:15,940
I just asked you

314
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,349
why your face is this big.

315
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:19,589
I mean your facial shape

316
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,390
is big.

317
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,390
Then,

318
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,589
how about this?

319
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,710
Why are you playing dumb?

320
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,750
Can you get out?

321
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,350
I'm fine, I just want
to rest for two days.

322
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,190
Every job provides annual leaves.

323
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,870
Is that too much for a writer

324
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,070
to rest for several weeks?

325
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,980
This is not a break.

326
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,030
You're attaining mortality.

327
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,110
As your editor,

328
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,030
I can't sit there

329
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,310
and watch you ascend.

330
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,870
I don't need an editor
to worry about me.

331
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,710
How about this?

332
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,030
Let's eat out later.

333
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,030
It's my treat.

334
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,030
I know there's a restaurant nearby

335
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,470
which sells delicious beef pot.

336
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,070
Let's go.

Eat out?

338
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,350
The 7th rule of the tenancy rules.

339
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,150
"No outside food as cover-up."

340
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,940
And you violated the 8th rule just now.

341
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,750
"Taking advantage of
living under the same roof

342
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,750
to do something beyond the
relationship between the landlord

and the tenant is forbidden..."

Stop!

345
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,750
The 4th rule. "Respect your landlord."

The 5th rule. "Respect..."

I'll get out first.

348

If you don't come out in half an hour,

349

I'll let Er Gou destroy this house.

Have you finished writing the book?

00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,950
Why do you mention book
once you see me?

Go back and write it
if you haven't finished.

I refuse to.

375
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,750
Exercising makes me
feel better when writing.

376
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,990
Then just exercise near your house.

377
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,910
Don't come here.

378
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,950
The air and view here are good.

Yun Fei,

381
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,310
I'm not a young lady.

00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,670
I know what you're thinking.

383
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,390
I'll make it clear with you.

384
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,790
This won't work for us.

385
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,950
Why won't it work?

386
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,790
You are

387
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,150
a young lady to me.

388
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,510
What's wrong with me?

389
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,870
I won't date the author.

390
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,630
Do you refuse to date an author

391
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,340
or me?

392
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,270
I heard that

393
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,390
you had

394
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,870
dated Mr Jiang Yu Cheng before.

395
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,150
Right?

396
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,430
Just ask the one

397
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,150
you heard it from.

398
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,950
Then just leave this aside.

399
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,790
What if I

400
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,110
like you?

401
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,990
I want to court you,

402
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,460
and I want to date you?

403
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,910
I have a headache.

404
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,420
Did you have a fight with your family?

405
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,630
Did Jiang Yu Cheng tell you?

406
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,670
He really has a blabbermouth.

407
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,630
No, no. He didn't say anything.

408
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,990
I just guessed it.

409
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,630
You asked me

410
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,190
if I have no childhood
or I'm heartless.

411
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,950
Why I don't miss my time as a student?

412
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,260
I really don't miss it.

413
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,590
How is it possible?

414
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,790
People like you...

415
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,980
You have good looks

416
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,150
and you're talented.

417
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,620
You're great in writing

418
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,670
and you're graduated
from top university.

419
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,270
Your school days

420
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,830
should be your finest moment.

421
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,790
Let me tell you a story about a friend.

422
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:22,910
[Father,]

423
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,790
[have you read my manuscript?]

424
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,670
[Is it all written by you?]

425
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,790
[It should have more
than 200,000 words.]

426
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,140
[I didn't count the words.]

427
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,590
[When do you start to write it?]

428
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,870
[I think I started from senior one. ]

429
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,230
[I wrote it once I had the time.]

430
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,940
[How is it?]

431
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,870
[I finally realize]

432
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,550
[the reason why your result]

433
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,630
[didn't improve]

434
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,150
[in your senior years.]

435
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,180
[You wasted your time and energy]

436
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,030
[on writing this meaningless stuff.]

437
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,550
[This stuff?]

438
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,150
[Then what kind of
stuff did you write?]

439
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,550
[What kind of attitude is that?]

440
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,990
[A man should know his place.]

441
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,950
[You've been rejected
by several publishing houses.]

442
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,190
[It wasn't for no reason.]

443
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,830
[I can hardly read]

444
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,630
[half of your manuscripts.]

445
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,100
[I don't know what you're writing!]

446
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,350
[Tell me]

447
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,030
[what you're trying to say.]

448
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,470
[Does your novel
mention any real life?]

449
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,230
[Does it have any social sense?]

450
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,910
[Does it have your own thought?]

451
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,710
[Nothing at all!]

452
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,710
[Some of them is just self-righteous]

453
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,820
[wit and pubertal venting.]

454
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,110
[A shallow novel like this
which is only for entertainment]

455
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,910
[will never be
considered as literature.]

456
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,860
[I can teach you the correct]

457
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,430
[literary writing]

458
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,060
[after your college
entrance exam ends.]

459
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,910
[I don't want to write anymore.]

460
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,100
[What does that mean?]

461
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,070
[Does the stuff you
write have any point?]

462
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,630
[You are just imposing]

463
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,990
[your value on others.]

464
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,100
[Saying that your
writing is meaningless,]

465
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,150
[this is me being gentle.]

466
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,230
[If I were to be harsh,]

467
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,870
[I would say what you write is trash!]

468
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,470
[It's a waste of papers!]

469
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,470
[Are you satisfied?]

470
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,950
No way!

471
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,710
That was cruel!

472
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,990
How could he tear his son apart

473
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,510
after working so hard to raise him?

474
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,500
Are you talking about my father or me?

475
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,030
You guys are in the same strain.

476
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,910
So,

477
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,230
Oriental Beauty is not
your first novel.

478
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,270
It's not. My first novel

479
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,820
was called trash by my father.

480
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,390
So, now you know why I refused to

481
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,660
sign the contract with Miao.

482
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,710
Apart from being a glib,

483
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,060
he always talks about
father-son enterprise.

484
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,230
"Mr Zhou senior must
be very proud of you."

485
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,790
"Father and son make a literary family."

486
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,990
He would say the words that I

487
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,950
hate the most in my life
within ten seconds.

488
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,630
So,

489
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,270
I could only tell him to stay out.

490
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,510
Mr Zhou Chuan, I didn't expect

491
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,340
there's such bitterness

492
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,350
behind your smile.

493
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,180
I didn't expect you can still create
Oriental Beauty, such masterpiece

494
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,350
after your maiden work was torn.

495
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,990
I really admire

496
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,070
your indomitable spirit.

497
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,150
Did you learn this

498
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,550
exaggerate expression from Miao?

499
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,700
Do I look alike?

500
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,630
Your flattering gaze isn't alike.

501
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,870
But Mr Zhou Chuan, to be honest.

502
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,470
I believe that you can get back up

503
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,750
in front of your detractors

504
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,390
after Book of Luo He God is published

505
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,550
and say aloud,

506
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,470
"Look, I did it!"

507
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,670
You can invite me if you think

508
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,990
you have insufficient aura.

509
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,870
Why are you staring at me?

510
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,790
I... I'm just thinking that

511
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,070
you look cute today.

512
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,220
But your face is big.

513
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,630
Here, here!

514
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,230
Eat a sweet ice cream when you're upset.

515
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,470
I don't want to eat it.

516
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,750
Try this ice-cream.

517
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,230
It's very delicious.

518
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,230
I don't want to.

519
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,750
It's too sweet.

520
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,430
Right, it's quite sweet.

521
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,510
Let's go home early.

522
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,750
Er Gou is waiting for us to feed him.

523
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,350
I warn you.

524
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,070
Don't engage in such
boring activity anymore.

525
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,910
Okay.

526
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,430
Sister.

527
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,910
We have a special rapport.

528
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,630
Why are you here again?

529
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,630
I'm here to court you.

530
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,150
Are you free tonight?

531
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:58,910
I'll eat with you.

532
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,430
I'm not free. I'm going somewhere.

533
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,590
I'll come with you.

534
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,790
It's a private matter.

535
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,230
I... No.

536
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,340
I'll never disturb you.

537
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,350
I'm already here, sister.

538
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,590
Get in the car.

539
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,990
So, this dictionary is published!

540
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,150
I'm not dreaming, right?

541
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,230
You're not dreaming.

542
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,390
I thought

543
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,980
once the data dictionary has launched,

544
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,910
this thing I made

545
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,380
would be completely worthless.

546
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,070
Why would it be worthless?

547
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,670
The gold will shine one day.

548
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,030
I put seven years of my life into it!

549
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,030
It's not wasted.

550
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,830
I can

551
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,310
retire comfortably now.

552
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,750
Why didn't you take Jiang with you?

553
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,110
Has he finished writing his new book?

554
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,590
His new book is already on sale.

555
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,870
He is too busy recently.

556
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,830
I'll take him to visit you
after some time.

557
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,670
Okay, okay.

558
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,030
Time to eat.

559
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,790
Let me treat you
with a cup of juice tea.

560
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,870
Then,

561
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,470
I want to tell you a good news.

562
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,470
Thanks for your juice tea.

563
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,310
What is the good news?

564
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,470
After a few days of the publication of

565
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,910
The Disappearing Amusement Park,

566
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,830
there're many letters from the readers.

567
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,430
I think it's obvious
that Mr Jiang Yu Cheng

568
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,630
will become famous again.

569
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,420
I'll be happy as long as Mr Jiang

570
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,750
could keep writing

571
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,550
new articles.

572
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,350
Then I pray for your teacher

573
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,950
to keep on writing and succeeding.
How is it?

574
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,630
Everyone come take
two movie tickets from me.

575
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,670
Movie ticket?

576
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,500
This is the perk comes with Yuan Yue.

577
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,630
There's a replay of a movie

578
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,670
about an author and an editor this week.

579
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,460
By then, you can

580
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,190
watch it with an author
who is close with you.

581
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,830
It's a chance to build
rapport with them.

582
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,510
Okay, thank you, Chief Editor.

583
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,230
Okay.

584
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,550
Thank you, Chief Editor.

585
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,630
Chu Li.

586
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,460
The respond of
Jiang Yu Cheng's serial is good.

587
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,550
This is the publishing contract of
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

588
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,180
But

589
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,310
the minimum guaranteed print run
the Marketing Department provides

590
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,790
is the same with Book of Luo He God.

591
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,950
He said since you could score this number

592
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,150
and handled Zhou Chuan, then
you can also handle Jiang Yu Cheng.

593
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,790
But the styles of these two authors

594
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,990
are totally different.

595
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,820
I know. I know.

596
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,870
It's hard.

597
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,150
But... That's why you should find a way

598
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,750
to take Mr Jiang and make him

599
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,030
sign the agreement promptly.

600
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,550
I understand.

601
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,990
I'll try my best.

602
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,710
All right.

603
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,910
Then do you want to
watch it with Mr Zhou Chuan

604
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,510
or Mr Jiang Yu Cheng?

605
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,430
Make your own decision.

606
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,100
Do you mean the movie?

607
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,870
If I invite Mr Zhou Chuan,

608
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,700
he'll tell me not to bother him

609
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,070
with such boring activity.

610
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,830
And he'll stick these two movie tickets

611
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,150
on my forehead as if they are

612
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,470
Demon Sedative Amulets.

613
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,310
Sister,

614
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,540
is Ms Liu your relative?

615
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,870
Don't ask something you shouldn't.

616
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,150
When is that dictionary

617
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,540
published?

618
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,590
Why haven't I seen it before?

619
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,940
That dictionary was planned to publish

620
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,990
but it got cancelled.

621
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,590
Ms Liu had made painstaking efforts in it.

622
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,420
She couldn't accept that

623
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,300
and had sudden cerebral haemorrhage.

624
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,110
That's why she lives here.

625
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,390
I see.

626
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,350
So, Ms Liu is your senior.

627
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,950
Then why was the publication cancelled?

628
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,910
Why do you have so many questions?

629
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,430
That's because I want to know you more.

630
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,030
Okay, I'll ask other people

631
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,030
if you don't want to tell me.

632
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,630
I was Ms Liu's apprentice.

633
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,990
As for the cancellation
of the publication,

634
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,310
who would buy

635
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,910
a paper dictionary nowadays?

636
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,260
The era has changed.

637
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,950
Mr Zhou Chuan.

638
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,390
The new books are on the shelf over there.

639
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,430
Okay, thank you.

640
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,670
Mr Zhou Chuan.

641
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,110
Chief Editor Yu.

642
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,750
What a coincidence!

643
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,790
Right, that's a coincidence!

644
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,700
I was talking to one of my authors.

645
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,990
Right, has Chu Li invited you?

646
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,950
Our company

647
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,270
has given out two movie tickets

648
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,630
to each person.

649
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,350
If Chu Li invites you,

650
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,670
please accept her.

651
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,670
This...

652
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,110
About the movie, I...

653
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,230
I don't really like to watch movie.

654
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,990
Why don't you ask her
to invite other person?

655
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,430
I think Chu Li must be really sincere

656
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,990
if she invites you.

657
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,630
Just consider it as a senior

658
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,580
taking the junior to edify sentiment.

659
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,510
And let her learn from you.

660
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,590
All right.

661
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,750
I'll reluctantly agree to it

662
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,590
if you say so.

663
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,470
Mr Zhou Chuan, you're a gentleman,

664
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,580
very generous.

665
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,420
I'm sorry, I've got a call.

666
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,190
I'll go to work first.

667
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:25,710
Go ahead.

668
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,630
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

669
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,030
Hello.

670
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,550
Just call that number will do.

671
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,550
Mr Zhou Chuan,

672
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,710
are you going to
walk the red carpet?

673
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,110
The Ideal Empire?

674
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,580
The original version of
The Ideal Empire is written in Greek.

675
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,670
You're reading the
English version which is

676
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,150
translated from the Chinese version.

677
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,180
There are two languages in between.

678
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,870
It will create biases
from the original text.

679
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,470
I suggest you

680
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,910
to read the Chinese version.

681
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,510
Those translation experts

682
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,790
are professional after all.

683
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,310
I'm going to cook now.

684
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,310
Teacher, I've drafted the agreement.

685
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,270
I'll send it to you

686
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,830
if you're free tomorrow.

687
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,870
What are you doing?

688
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,630
Who are you talking with?

689
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,510
Mr Jiang, who else would it be?

690
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,790
Tomorrow is your day off.

691
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,860
Why don't you sleep in?

692
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,790
Why do you want to send agreement?

693
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,820
Just send it to him by delivery.

694
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,910
Why do I have to send delivery
while we're living in the same city?

695
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,870
Yuan Yue Publishing House
has given me two movie tickets.

696
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,230
Let's go and watch it together

697
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,270
if you're free.

698
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,670
It's about author and editor...

699
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,219
You're going to watch
the movie with Jiang Yu Cheng?

700
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,710
Are two of you close enough
to watch movie together?

701
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,030
And Yuan Yue Publishing House

702
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,429
doesn't stipulate that
Jiang Yu Cheng must watch it.

703
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,429
It gave two movie tickets

704
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,350
for you to watch it
with anyone you like.

705
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,790
Right, Yuan Yue Publishing House
didn't stipulate

706
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,989
the person I want to watch it with.

707
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:31,989
But aren't we going out

708
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,870
together tomorrow?

709
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,190
We can watch it together then.

710
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,260
Give it back to me.

711
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,420
Then

712
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,620
what movie are you planning to watch?

713
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,670
City of Words.

714
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,429
This movie is replaying recently.

715
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,429
Of course I know it.

716
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,429
You know it?

717
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:52,710
Why?

718
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,590
Am I not allowed to take interest in

719
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,750
theatrical and biography movie?

720
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,270
I'm planning to watch it too.

721
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,469
You're planning to watch it?

722
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,350
So,

723
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,230
don't watch it with Jiang Yu Cheng.

724
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,750
First come, first served.

725
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,310
I said I want to watch it first.

726
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,150
It's me who stand in front of you first.

727
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,270
Isn't one of these

728
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,190
two movie tickets supposed to be mine?

729
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,110
That's not reasonable.

730
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,630
Why is it not reasonable?

731
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,110
We have the same editor.

732
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,870
Ain't I your author?

733
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,070
Yuan Yue Publishing House didn't mention

734
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,740
that you must give
this ticket to Jiang Yu Cheng.

735
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,150
Why can't you give it to me?

736
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,830
You make me feel dizzy.

737
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,550
[Okay, then see you tomorrow at noon.]

738
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,700
[I'll buy you lunch.]

739
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,270
[What do you want to eat?]

740
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,470
Let's go and watch it tonight.

741
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,510
Let's eat out and watch the movie.

742
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,350
Don't do that.

743
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,820
It's just a movie ticket.

744
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,230
It's only 38 yuan.

745
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,510
Aren't they money?

746
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,510
38 yuan is money as well.

747
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,420
How about this?

748
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,230
Both of you go and watch it.

749
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,110
I'm not going.

750
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,070
Two authors watch this kind of movie?

751
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,030
What are we going to do?

752
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,070
Complaining about

753
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,510
how unreliable the current editor is

754
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,510
or teasing each other?

755
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,790
"This drained author looks like you."

756
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,350
"The arrogant and annoying look

757
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,350
of this male lead looks familiar."

758
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,710
Okay, I surrender.

759
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,870
How about this?

760
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,350
You and Mr Jiang, each of you will get

761
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,790
one of these two free movie tickets.

762
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,990
I'll buy this movie ticket which

763
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,630
costs 38 yuan with my own money

764
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,710
and sit between you guys.

765
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,830
I won't give him a chance

766
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,950
to tease you for being arrogant.

767
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,740
And I won't give you a chance

768
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,590
to tease him for being drained.

769
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,630
That's okay, right?

770
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,070
Can you leave here

771
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,550
if there's nothing else?

772
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,590
Can you cut the potatoes

773
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,180
and beef for me

774
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,270
if you have nothing to do?

775
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,140
We're having beef
stewed with potatoes tonight.

776
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,460
I want to eat pizza

777
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,510
tomorrow at noon.

778
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,870
Ask Jiang Yu Cheng to treat us.

779
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,470
Chu Li,

780
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,750
why is he here?

781
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,670
He? He...

782
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,830
Unfortunately,

783
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,550
while you're maintaining
the relationships

784
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,790
of author and managing editor with her,

785
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,790
so am I.

786
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,510
One order of red wine
bovine tendon pizza with thin crust.

787
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,420
Extra cheese, thank you.

788
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,790
Why do you wear like this today?

789
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,670
You can only wear it out

790
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,950
if you were ten years younger.

791
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,590
I've never seen your suit too.

792
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,030
Why? Did you buy it last night

793
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,390
and ask for urgent delivery?

794
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,110
Aren't we here to watch movie?

795
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,230
Why do you wear

796
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,070
like a playboy?

797
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,910
This is to respect the lady.

798
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,590
Who would be like you?

799
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,590
As if you were going to
walk the red carpet of the Oscars.

800
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,070
I look formal with whatever I wear.

801
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,310
I can't help it too.

802
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,510
I'm frustrated too.

803
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,270
I want to eat chicken pizza.

804
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,950
I'm sorry, Chu Li.

805
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,790
It's easy to be childish

806
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,350
when being with someone.

807
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,270
Follow her orders.

808
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,150
And extra cheese.

809
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,260
[City of Words]

810
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,750
Chu Li.

811
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,460
You eat snack after having meal?

812
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,710
Is your stomach an abyss?

813
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,430
I'm full that

814
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,660
I'm almost puke as the pizza is huge.

815
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,990
That's because
you've eaten too much, okay?

816
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,550
I...

817
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,180
Here.

818
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,030
Thank you, Mr Jiang.

819
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,030
It's all sweet.

820
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,790
Are you treating her like a child?

821
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,980
Have you heard a saying?

822
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,990
Gift blind the eyes.

823
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,790
I'm helping you to
accommodate the awkwardness

824
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,990
in case your food is wasted.

825
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,310
Didn't you just have meal?

826
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,190
Why are you eating again?

827
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,030
I just ate a small piece.

828
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,910
You're heavy enough.

829
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:04,430
You...

830
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,670
Why do you say something this harsh?

831
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,950
I tell you what.

832
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,030
If Er Gou was a female,

833
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,230
he would have left the house.

834
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,270
Thanks for speaking up, Mr Jiang.

835
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,020
Someone is really poor

836
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,590
as he's mooching meals.

837
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,100
You even want to
treat us dinner after lunch.

838
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,190
Are you thinking that you're rich?

839
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,310
I suggest you to transfer it
to my bank card.

840
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,590
I want to treat Chu Li to dinner

841
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,820
not you.

842
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,030
I'm just planning to

843
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,590
go to the same restaurant.

844
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,390
I didn't say I'm going to mooch meals.

845
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,150
I'm not telling you
which restaurant we booked.

846
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,590
Then I insist to follow you

847
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,790
and see which restaurant you go.

848
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,990
Why don't we go back home

849
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,230
and have our own meal?

850
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,380
I agree.

851
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,630
I have someone to prepare
three meals for me anyway.

852
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,590
You've hire a new maid?

853
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,550
And you have the audacity

854
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,830
to follow us?

855
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,230
You must be rich then.

856
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,510
I didn't hire a cooking maid.

857
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,990
She even walks the dog, writes
and watches television with me.

858
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,110
Who is that unfortunate

859
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,270
to become your girlfriend?

860
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,870
It's said that the cover illustrator of
Book of Luo He God

861
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,670
has a crush on you.

862
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,430
The time matches too.

863
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,430
Is it really Cocoon?

864
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,110
Am I blind?

865
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:29,980
Then who is she?

866
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,550
[Watch your mouth and your language.]

867
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,400
[Little Monkey]

868
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,870
[Beware of ruining my innocence.

869
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,590
Is your girlfriend looking for you?

870
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,230
Go home and accompany her.

871
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,670
Do you think I like to
follow you around?

872
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,890
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour]

873
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,230
[Go home with me.]

874
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,310
Mr Zhou Chuan, goodbye.

875
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,390
Be careful on the way home.

876
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,390
He really left.

877
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,840
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour]

878
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,310
Mr Jiang,

879
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,950
can we talk about
the publication contract?

880
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,630
Mr Jiang, take a look.

881
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,870
The number in the agreement

882
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:36,310
is the same with Zhou Chuan's
Book of Luo He God.

883
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,750
But...

884
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,550
I'm sorry, Chu Li.

885
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,670
I think you know

886
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,990
what I'm going to say.

887
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,070
I, too, know

888
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,350
what you're going to say.

889
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,710
It doesn't matter that the minimum
guaranteed print run is less.

890
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,430
What matters is Yuan Yue
Publishing House can sell it.

891
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,590
As long as the sales
of this book is high,

892
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,190
then you'll pay me a reasonable royalty,

893
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,990
right?

894
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,790
Did you convince
Zhou Chuan with the same way?

895
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,510
Seems like Mr Zhou Chuan
has complaint to you.

896
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,590
Of course,

897
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,790
there're many other reasons.

898
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,830
Zhou Chuan

899
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,030
is arrogant

900
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,500
and has Eighth Grader Syndrome.

901
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,230
Perhaps he's full of ego too.

902
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,270
He's willing to sign
Book of Luo He God over to you.

903
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,190
It's more of

904
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,510
having self-confidence

905
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,150
than having faith in you.

906
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,140
You're right.

907
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,190
I know that.

908
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,030
But I'm different.

909
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,510
About The Disappearing Zoo,

910
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,070
I've created a miracle
in the sales volume

911
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,790
of rookies in the publishing industry.

912
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,470
For the second and third series,

913
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:41,270
each of them was
the famous book for everyone.

914
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,990
They were placed on
the best-seller spot in every bookstore.

915
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,630
But the fact is

916
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,830
every book I wrote has been

917
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,990
in downward trend since then.

918
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,340
Those two books that
I recently published

919
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,100
have poor sales too.

920
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,300
I can't afford to lose.

921
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,150
Mr Jiang.

922
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,030
But I've said that

923
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,990
I'll give you a chance.

924
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:08,990
What chance?

925
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,900
Please give me a satisfying figure
after Zhou Chuan's

926
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,390
Book of Luo He God is published.

927
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,070
Like you said before,

928
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,510
prove it to me.

929
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,670
Let me see

930
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,580
your value as an editor.

931
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,590
If you can't even handle
a famous author

932
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:30,860
like Zhou Chuan,

933
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,390
then don't even think about

934
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,150
helping someone like me.

935
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,630
It's embarrassing to talk about

936
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,990
the sales volume and

937
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,100
the terms of royalty

938
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,790
in front of my fan.

939
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:54,740
Do you feel disillusioned?

940
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,470
No, I don't feel that way.

941
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,830
I'm different from Zhou Chuan.

942
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,750
Right, you guys are quite different.

943
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,470
He only wants to write happily.

944
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,190
For me, I want more.

945
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:18,470
Mr Zhou Chuan publishes
his book with rage.

946
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,590
He wants to show that his father

947
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,140
was wrong with his achievement.

948
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,070
You've shifted with the market
from the beginning.

949
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,310
You're the chosen one,

950
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:27,630
a best-selling author.

951
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:29,430
Everyone gets what they need.

952
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,310
There's neither lowliness nor nobleness.

953
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,830
Being a commercial author
is nothing to be ashamed of.

954
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,420
If you have no desire

955
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,390
to write,

956
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,500
then things you write
will never be a big seller.

957
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,790
Moreover, I've seen it.

958
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:45,230
You are genuine when writing this book.
