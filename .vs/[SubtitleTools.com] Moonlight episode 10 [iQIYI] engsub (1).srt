The first batch consists of
87 booksellers.

430
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,910
These are the subscription forms.

Mr Liang.
What is the subscription quantity?

432
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,820
The total is 45,200 copies.

433
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,710
For the final conservative estimate,
hitting 200 thousand isn't a problem.

434
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,230
It's only been the first day.

435
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,350

436

our breakeven point for printing.

437
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,190
Is it really 45,200 copies?

we can achieve a solid

00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,150
Autograph?

677
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,830
Autograph might not be that attractive.

678
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,830
Not attractive?

679
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,150
How about lucky draw for forwarded post?

680
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,949
This is very important.

681
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,420
Do you have any private item?

682
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,830
Private item?

683
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,469
My editor's head.

684
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,710
Oh, right. Mr Zhou Chuan.

685
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,150
Why were you on the street today?

686
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,230
You weren't even walking the dog.

687
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,750
I was on my way

688
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,700
to the convenience store.

689
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,270
Nothing odd about that.

690
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,820
Why don't we take a cab...

691
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,590
[Chu Li, don't forget our appointment]

692
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,520
[Flying Elephant]

693
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,260
[with the printing house
tomorrow evening.]

694
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:09,770
[Flying Elephant]

695
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,430
[I won't go the office tomorrow morning.]

696
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,030
[Mr Zhou Chuan wants to
have a meeting with me]

697
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,630
[about the exclusive giveaways.]

698
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,650
[Chu Li]

699
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,150
Get up.

700
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,790
Disinfect your wound before you sleep.

701
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,230
You'll get an infection if you don't.

702
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,660
If you don't get up now,

703
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,670
I'll pull out your pants.

704
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,230
Don't think that you can get away

705
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,550
with your good looks and writing skills.

706
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,670
I'll call the cops

707
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,310
if you do something to me when I'm asleep.

708
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,790
I just want you to get up

709
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,670
and take off your pants.

710
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,270
What?

711
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,630
You have to disinfect that knee.

712
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,100
You have been out all day.

713
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,350
Are you going to fall asleep
with all that?

714
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,060
Alright, I got it.

715
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,590
I can't take off my pants with you here.

716
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,030
Go downstairs now.

717
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,670
I'll take them off once you're gone.

718
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,390
You can't fool me with that.

719
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,470
It's a trick to get me out

720
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,550
so that you can continue sleeping,
isn't it?

721
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,390
No, no.

722
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,030
You go out first. I'll take them off.

723
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,350
Alright?

724
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,430
I'll come up to check in a while.

725
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,070
You sound like

726
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,150
a teacher

727
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,180
checking on a student's homework.

728
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,470
Go now.

729
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,550
Hello?

730
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,630
Buddy.

731
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,070
What got into you?

732
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,430
I'm not used to this.

733
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,150
What's the matter?

734
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,230
I think I'm undergoing puberty.

735
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,550
What happened?

736
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,910
I suddenly realize
the deep physical meaning

737
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,230
in gender distinction of mankind.

738
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,510
Man

739
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,870
and woman.

740
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,790
I don't understand.

741
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,630
It's tiring to explain to you.

742
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,070
Go downstairs to apply medicine

743
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,670
and come back up to bed.

744
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,070
You can sleep in tomorrow.

745
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,190
I've applied leave for you.

746
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,460
Just go to the printing house
in the evening.

747
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,470
Why are you fixing my schedule?

748
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,230
Flying Elephant texted you.

749
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,310
You looked at my phone?

750
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,630
The message popped up
according to your setting.

751
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,150
I can't unseen it.

752
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,710
Since I've seen it,

753
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,310
I decided to apply leave for you.

754
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,150
What's the problem?

755
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,700
This did sound like me.

756
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,750
I guessed it right.

757
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,510
You

758
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,470
always talk behind my back
with your colleagues.

759
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,270
"Mr Zhou Chuan is running late again."

760
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,670
"Who does he think he is?"

761
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,940
"The centre of the universe?"

762
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,350
You added that last one.

763
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,750
Your leg.

764
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,030
Stop jumping.

765
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,350
The stairs will collapse.

766
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,150
Don't you know you are heavy?

767
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,670
I must thank you for your trouble

768
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,030
to carry me home then.

769
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,470
I'm glad you know.

770
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,510
Get on.

771
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,150
Since I've started a good deed,
let me carry you down.

772
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,990
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

773
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,670
Go slow.

774
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,270
You pulled an all nighter

775
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,310
just for that 350 thousand.

776
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,390
If you don't hit that target,

777
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,390
you have to carry me
around the neighbourhood.

778
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,750
I don't want to.

779
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,830
Be gentle.

780
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,750
Are you making some embroidery?

781
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,270
At this rate,

782
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,660
it will take you forever.

783
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,230
Let me do it.

784
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,670
You know how to treat wounds?

785
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,750
I attended first aid training.

786
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,830
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

787
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,590
You really don't want to slit the wound

788
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,990
to check for residues?

789
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,030
What if the wound heals

790
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,310
with the residue still inside?

791
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,830
Let me do it myself.

792
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,710
Eight Treasure Congee?

793
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,670
Why is it so salty?

794
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,950
Mr Zhou Chuan.

795
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,790
I'm really sorry

796
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,950
I got up late this morning

797
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,510
and did not make you breakfast.

798
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,180
Oh, right.

799
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,670
Give me the phone number
of this take-out restaurant.

800
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,990
I want to file a complaint.

801
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,700
Food has dignity too.

802
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,110
This Eight Treasure Congee
is supposed to be sweet.

803
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,910
This is salty and inedible.

804
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,070
I made this.

805
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,950
You made this?

806
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,830
Actually, it won't be salty

807
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,630
after adding hot water.

808
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,190
Then you should have more.

809
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,950
Eight Treasure Congee can boost your qi
and nourish your blood.

810
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,950
It's perfect for hard workers like you.

811
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,070
You made this congee just for me?

812
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,750
Yes.

813
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,990
I'm afraid if you work yourself to death,

814
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,390
no one can help me
hit the 350 thousand target.

815
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,550
I knew it.

816
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,470
Hello? Chief Editor Yu.

817
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,380
Really?

818
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,790
I'll tell him now.

819
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,870
Good news.

820
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,630
Pre-sales of your book starts next week.

821
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:05,300
I'll hashtag you
on all official platforms.

822
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,350
You must forward them out.

823
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,910
The more the better.

824
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,030
I'll have to pass this congee.

825
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,270
I need to go to the printing house now.

826
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,670
It's really too salty.

827
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,430
I've booked a cab for you.

828
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,270
I'll pay for it.

829
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,630
Goodbye.
