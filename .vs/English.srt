00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,740
What do you need to use my phone for?

165
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,000
To call the police.

166
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,990
- Why are you calling the police?
- You crashed into me.

167
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,940
No, no, I can explain, that's not what happened.

168
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,880
Then just handle it by reporting to the police.

169
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,670
Please, if there's a problem, we can talk it through.

170
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,500
Can you not call the police?

171
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,760
Please.

172
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,210
Then who am I?

173
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,010
You...

174
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,980
You don't know who you are?

175
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,420
I only remember that you crashed into me.

176
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,370
How do you feel?

177
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,940
A little dizzy.

178
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,870
Doctor, didn't he injure his leg?

179
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,550
How come I feel like his brain isn't working right either?

180
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,160
Judging from the examination, there shouldn't be a problem.

181
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,970
But getting hit from an outside force can cause a light concussion.

182
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,160
That can bring about temporary memory loss.

183
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,600
Outside force?

184
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,820
I didn't—

185
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,900
Then, how long will his condition last?

186
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,580
That's hard to say. Two to three days,

187
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,360
or several months are all within the realm of possibility.

188
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,110
First pay the fee, then take the bill to get medicine.

189
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,620
Rest well.

190
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,440
Pay the fee.

191
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,900
Thank you.

192
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,330
[¥35,981 (~$5,600)]

193
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,890
Excuse me, may I ask,

194
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,090
can you give a discount?

195
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,520
There are no discounts.

196
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,900
This... why is it so expensive?

197
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,400
Was the head of the hospital the operating surgeon?

198
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,490
The surgery fee isn't expensive, but doesn't he also have to be hospitalized?

199
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,860
Then if he doesn't stay in the hospital, how much does it cost?

200
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,660
¥13,000 (~$2,000).

201
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,710
Then let's not stay in the hospital.

202
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,560
What a handsome face. It would be such a shame if it left a scar.

203
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,150
You should buy insurance for this face.

204
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,030
My face didn't get injured too badly, did it?

205
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,420
Even a small injury is an injury.

206
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,490
You have to look after even a small injury.

207
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,310
I'll leave now.

208
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,950
Thank you.

209
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,590
The doctor said you don't have to stay in the hospital.

210
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,110
You just have to come back for a follow-up visit at the set date.

211
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,320
I'll go down to complete the paperwork to be discharged from the hospital.

212
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,360
You can get your things ready, and then we can leave.

213
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,960
Did you hear me?

214
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,370
What is this?

215
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,970
The compensation you will have to pay.

216
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,580
A professional carer,

217
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,300
nutritionalist, Hilton presidential suite.

218
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,000
Total expenses equal 300,000 yuan.
(~$47,000)

219
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,390
Are you blackmailing me?

220
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,160
Then call the police. Have the police take care of it.

221
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,620
A collision that results in an injury is not a minor charge. Not to mention whether or not my leg will have long term consequences,

222
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,040
the compensation and damages from absent at work alone are more than 300,000 yuan.

223
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,520
And you'll also have to go to the police station, be detained for three to five days, and cooperate with the police investigation.

224
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,310
Do you still think I'm blackmailing you?

225
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,910
Didn't you lose your memory?

226
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,690
You've lost your memory yet you're going to this extent—

227
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,740
I did lose my memory, but I didn't become stupid. Past experiences are still in my head.

228
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,130
Let's talk about the compensation instead.

229
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,090
I really don't have money.

230
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,990
After I paid the bills,

231
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,420
I now only have 1,888 yuan left.
(~$300)

232
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,320
Wait a moment.

233
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,790
Sister Li.

234
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,240
Anxin, shouldn't you pay your rent for this month now?

235
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,260
No, Sister Li. I just sent it to you a couple days ago.

236
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,080
I told you long ago. The rent increases this month. Did you forget?

237
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,310
By fifty—

238
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,320
No, Sister Li. Isn't fifty percent a little too high?

239
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,130
Little sister, many people are fighting for your house.

240
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:54,360
I saw that life isn't easy for you so I never rented it to someone else.

241
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,040
If you're tight on money, then how about you make some room for others?

242
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,070
I can't, Sister Li. I'll send it to you. I'll send it right now.

243
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,150
Bye, Sister Li.

[Remaining balance 888 yuan.]

247
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,690
Eight, eight, eight. This number is quite auspicious.

248
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,150
Look, I really don't have money.

249
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,560
I just paid my rent.

250
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,150
- So?
- So...

251
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,420
So...

252
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,380
So, how about...you live at my house?

253
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,040
My house is pretty luxurious.

254
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,950
It won't be much worse than that...Hilton Hotel.

255
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,870
And if you need any carers,

256
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,460
I can be your carer. Does that work?

257
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,570
It's not that it won't work.

258
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,720
But you'll have to write me an IOU.

259
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,040
I, Gu An Xin, on the evening of May 5,

260
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,950
accidentally crashed into and injured the victim.

261
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,300
To compensate for the victim's variety of losses,

262
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,700
I am willing to listen to the victim's requests.

263
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,120
During his recovery period, I will provide a place to live and take care of his daily life

264
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,750
until the amount owed 280,000 yuan is paid in full.
(~$43,000)

265
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,670
Can you be discharged now, Mr. Victim?

266

[IOU]

267

What do I call you from now on?

00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,160
Anything.

269
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,660
But I can't keep calling you "victim."

270
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,920
As long as you can pay attention to the road, you can call me anything.

271
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,720
I only have 888 yuan left in my card today.

272

How about I call you...Xiao Ba. Okay?
(eight is pronounced "ba")

273
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,300
Anything is fine.

274
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,450
Just say "anything." Why  be mean?

275
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,190
Here.

276
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,950
People can really live here?

277
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,700
What do you mean by if people can really live here?

278
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,170
I've lived here for years now.

279
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,460
Then which floor do you live on?

280
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,580
The second floor. Right there.

281
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,030

282
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,230
Let's go.

283
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,240
You don't have an elevator?

284
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,850
Only stairs.

285
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,300
Moreover, it's only the second floor. I will help you up.

286
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,890
What?

287
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,630
No need. Just lead the way.

288
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,460
I can walk myself.

289
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,620
What do I wear?

290
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,590
I only have one pair of slippers.

291
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,340
How about...I give you one. I'll go buy new ones for you tomorrow.

292
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,530
Totally luxurious.

293
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,390
Drink some water.

294
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,980
What is that?

295
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,530
This is something that all cups have when used for a long time.

296
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,100
Probably water marks.

297
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,450
It's fine. You won't die. Drink it.

298
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,820
It's clean now.

299
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,910
Where do I sleep?

300
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,430
I can't sleep on the couch, right? I'm still a patient.

301
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,430
I'll give you a tour of the bedroom.

302
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,560
You draw comics?

303
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,230
I doodle when I'm bored.

304
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,960
I'm just a delivery man.

305
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,750
Sit anywhere. I will tidy up this place for you.

306
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,430
Don't touch.

307
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,710
Is that your mom?

308
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,420
Does it have anything to do with you?

309
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,280
Just asking.

310
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,470
I'm telling you, you can sleep in my bedroom.

311
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,800
but you can't touch anything in my bedroom.

312
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,370
These are all my treasures. I bought them with my savings.

313
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,230
Heard me?

314
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,250
No need. I will sleep on the couch.

315
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,270
Theres no air conditioning. Only a fan.

316
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,790
If you think it's too hot, then you can only bear it.

317
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,530
What is it?

318
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,530
The couch can't be placed under the fan.

319
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,630
Why? Are there any Feng Shui specifications for that?

320
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,200
It's too dangerous.

321
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,360
How is it dangerous?

322
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,130
Either you move the couch,

323
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,760
- Cou—
- Otherwise,

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,400
if you don't mind, I can sleep in the same room with you.

325
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:44,040
You...you look pretty normal. You aren't going to do anything to me, right?

326
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,100
Not necessarily.

327
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,130
- I'm warning you—
- I'm also warning you.

328
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,000
You still owe me 280,000 yuan.
(~43,000)

329
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,500
Not 280,000 yuan.

330
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,460
It's 272,000 yuan.
(~42,000)

331
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:08,400
The water bill, room and board,

332
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,170
the tricycle, and the costs of my care.

333
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:16,240
Adding all of this up, it's about 8,000 yuan.
(~$1,000)

334
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,500
So now, I still owe you 272,000 yuan.

335
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,490
So was your service more expensive or this shabby house of yours?

336
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,370
How is my house shabby? I even have a luxurious big bathtub.

337
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:33,230
Furthermore, my service is 24 hours,

338
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,800
personal service. This is cheap enough already.

339
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,110
How personal?

340
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,930
Within 3 meters,

341
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,190
1 meter away.

342
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,140
Okay.

343
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,530
Then listen carefully.

344
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,720
I only drink mineral water. I only use 100% cotton towels.

345
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,640
The lights must be out in the living room by 11:00 PM. You're not allowed to bother me after that.

346
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,720
I've only thought of these. I will add on when I think of the rest.

347
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,700
Why does your brain work so well even though you've lost your memory?

348
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,680
I will emphasize this once more. I have a temporary memory gap.

349
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,990
Not dementia. Those who can't do anything when they lose their memory only belong in tv dramas.

350
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,530
Go, move the couch.

351
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,190
The Big Bad Wolf and Little Sheep

352
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,820
Why is there still so little clicks?

353
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,770
You can eat cup noodles at noon, a very good deal.

354
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,210
Breakfast is on the table.

355
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,030
Your mineral water is in the fridge.

356
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,640
Second-hand clothes are under the couch.

357
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,580
Yellow one is mine. Blue one is yours.

358
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,990
How come there's a fire at house 208?

359
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,180
I heard the microwave caught on fire.

360
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,990
- 208?
- Yeah.

361
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,280
What happened to my house?

362
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,050
In the future, when using appliances, you must be careful.

363
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,840
Don't put metal in the microwave.

364
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,500
Microwave...

365
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,780
You've never used a microwave at your house, right?

366
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,870
If you have nothing to do, go take a stroll outside. Don't mess up the house.

367
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,090
This is all money.

368
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,290
Damage of appliance, 600 yuan.
(~$100)

369
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,200
My phone number.

370
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,850
If you run into trouble then call me but I hope that you have no reason to call.

371
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,550
Okay?

372
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,580
Hello?

373
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,170
Anxin, your brother broke the beer bottles in my store. You should come over quickly.

374
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,690
Brother?

375
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,980
Look at what my beer bottles have become.

376
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,460
- Sorry, sir.
- The delivery just arrived.

377
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,970
This beer is very expensive.

378
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,810
Your brother broke the whole crate.

379
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,540
I'm going to lose a lot of money.

380
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,660
That's all I have in cash right now.

381
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,020
When I get my paycheck I will send the rest to you immediately. Okay?

382
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,000
- Seriously.
- I told you to go take a stroll outside.

383
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,760
I didn't tell you to go out and take money for a walk.

384
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,310
- Hello?
- My son is crying and scared because of your husband.

385
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,210
Sorry, little kid.

386
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,070
You're Gu Anxin?

387
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,450
Why is a grown-up taking toys from a kid?

388
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,160
Can you watch your husband? Seriously.

389
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,740
I'm really sorry.

390
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,470
Little kid, sorry.

391
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,860
You can't sit still, right?

392
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,860
You can't let me do my work, right?

393
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,580
Anxin, there's a problem with your attendance lately.

394
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,090
You shouldn't disappear in the middle of work anymore, I'm reminding you out of goodwill.

395
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,000
Got it. It won't happen next time.

396
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,360
Hello?

397
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,810
Is this Gu Anxin? Your brother is lost. Come pick him up.

398
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,970
I'm warning you. You better have thought it carefully.

399
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,280
If you injure me you will have to compensate.

400
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,500
The ride fare for coming home today,

401
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,590
50 yuan. Damages from loss of work...

402
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,150
Damages are 600 yuan. And on the way back,

403
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,730
you got hungry and bought some food.

404
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,660
Fatigue fee.

405
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,370
Put it down.

406
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,530
I'm telling you, the most valuable thing at home

407
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,250
is this television. It's the most treasured by the landlord.

408
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:04,250
If it breaks, neither of us will be able to pay for it.

409
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,340
Look,

410
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,640
this red button.

411
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,320
If you press it, it will turn on.

412
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,740
Press it again, it will turn off.

413
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,240
You actually don't have to worry about the other buttons.

414
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,880
Just remember this one and it will be enough.

415
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,940
Give it a try.

416
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,550
He's crippled but has quite a big temper.

417
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,280
Toi...toilet. My toilet. Toilet.

418
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,590
What happened?

419
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,480
There's something in the bathroom.

420
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,690
Where?

421
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,370
It came out.

422
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,680
Just this?

423
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,340
- Is it really funny?
- Of course it's really funny.

424
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,090
Your size is a waste. You're afraid of cockroaches.

425
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,820
- Do you know how many types of bacteria are on a cockroach?
- How many?

426
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,500
- There are 48 types.
- Wow.

427
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,750
It can carry around at the most, 48 pathogens.

428
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,040
Parasite eggs, fungus, bacteria, and all that.

429
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,460
They will spread a lot of viruses.

430
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,270
Isn't the problem solved if you just step on them?

431
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,770
You think it ends with stepping on it?

432
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,570
Do you know how many larva it can create?

433
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,670
How many?

434
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,760
A single cockroach can produce 84 larva.

435
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,230
So, you're saying that there are 84 cockroaches in my house?

436
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,010
That's right.

437
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,710
I'm telling you, you haven't realized the severity of this issue.

438
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,010
Enough. Stop nagging.

439
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,060
I'll go buy pesticide for you tomorrow.

440
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,750
This cost will be your responsibility.

441
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,300
Because prior to your arrival, there were no cockroaches in my house.

442
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,950
What do you mean?

443
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,850
You mean that I brought this bacteria in?

444
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,740
I didn't say that. You said it yourself.

445
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,780
Oh right. I also need to remind you.

446
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,540
When it's the dead hours of the night,

447
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,640
and you're lying on the couch,

448
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,550
there are 84 cockroaches in the house now,

449
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,650
in case they crawl, crawl, and crawl in the night,

450
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,310
and crawl onto the couch,

451
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,640
take care.

452
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:05,710
