The first batch consists of
87 booksellers.

430
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,910
These are the subscription forms.

Mr Liang.
What is the subscription quantity?

432
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,820
The total is 45,200 copies.

433
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,710
For the final conservative estimate,
hitting 200 thousand isn't a problem.

434

It's only been the first day.

435
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,350

our breakeven point for printing.

437
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,190
Is it really 45,200 copies?

00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,150
Autograph?

677
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,830
Autograph might not be that attractive.

678
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,830
Not attractive?

679
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,150
How about lucky draw for forwarded post?

680
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,949
This is very important.

681
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,420
Do you have any private item?

682
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,830
Private item?

683
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,469
My editor's head.

684
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,710
Oh, right. Mr Zhou Chuan.

685
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,150
Why were you on the street today?

686
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,230
You weren't even walking the dog.

687
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,750
I was on my way

688
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,700
to the convenience store.

689
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,270
Nothing odd about that.

690
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,820
Why don't we take a cab...

691
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,590
[Chu Li, don't forget our appointment]

692
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,520
[Flying Elephant]

693
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,260
[with the printing house
tomorrow evening.]

694
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:59,770
[Flying Elephant]

695
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,430
[I won't go the office tomorrow morning.]

696
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,030
[Mr Zhou Chuan wants to
have a meeting with me]

697
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,630
[about the exclusive giveaways.]

698
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:00,650
[Chu Li]

699
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,150
Get up.

700
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,790
Disinfect your wound before you sleep.

701
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,230
You'll get an infection if you don't.

702
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,660
If you don't get up now,

703
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,670
I'll pull out your pants.

704
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,230
Don't think that you can get away

705
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,550
with your good looks and writing skills.

706
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,670
I'll call the cops

707
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,310
if you do something to me when I'm asleep.

708
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,790
I just want you to get up

709
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,670
and take off your pants.

710
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,270
What?

711
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,630
You have to disinfect that knee.

712
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,100
You have been out all day.

713
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,350
Are you going to fall asleep
with all that?

714
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,060
Alright, I got it.

715
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,590
I can't take off my pants with you here.

716
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,030
Go downstairs now.

717
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,670
I'll take them off once you're gone.

718
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,390
You can't fool me with that.

719
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,470
It's a trick to get me out

720
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,550
so that you can continue sleeping,
isn't it?

721
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,390
No, no.

722
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,030
You go out first. I'll take them off.

723
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,350
Alright?

724
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,430
I'll come up to check in a while.

725
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,070
You sound like

726
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,150
a teacher

727
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,180
checking on a student's homework.

728
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,470
Go now.

729
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,550
Hello?

730
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,630
Buddy.

731
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,070
What got into you?

732
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,430
I'm not used to this.

733
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,150
What's the matter?

734
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,230
I think I'm undergoing puberty.

735
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,550
What happened?

736
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,910
I suddenly realize
the deep physical meaning

737
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,230
in gender distinction of mankind.

738
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,510
Man

739
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,870
and woman.

740
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,790
I don't understand.

741
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,630
It's tiring to explain to you.

742
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,070
Go downstairs to apply medicine

743
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,670
and come back up to bed.

744
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,070
You can sleep in tomorrow.

745
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,190
I've applied leave for you.

746
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,460
Just go to the printing house
in the evening.

747
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,470
Why are you fixing my schedule?

748
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,230
Flying Elephant texted you.

749
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,310
You looked at my phone?

750
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,630
The message popped up
according to your setting.

751
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,150
I can't unseen it.

752
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,710
Since I've seen it,

753
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,310
I decided to apply leave for you.

754
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,150
What's the problem?

755
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,700
This did sound like me.

756
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,750
I guessed it right.

757
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,510
You

758
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,470
always talk behind my back
with your colleagues.

759
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,270
"Mr Zhou Chuan is running late again."

760
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,670
"Who does he think he is?"

761
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,940
"The centre of the universe?"

762
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,350
You added that last one.

763
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,750
Your leg.

764
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,030
Stop jumping.

765
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,350
The stairs will collapse.

766
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,150
Don't you know you are heavy?

767
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,670
I must thank you for your trouble

768
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,030
to carry me home then.

769
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,470
I'm glad you know.

770
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,510
Get on.

771
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,150
Since I've started a good deed,
let me carry you down.

772
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,990
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

773
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,670
Go slow.

774
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,270
You pulled an all nighter

775
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,310
just for that 350 thousand.

776
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,390
If you don't hit that target,

777
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,390
you have to carry me
around the neighbourhood.

778
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,750
I don't want to.

779
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,830
Be gentle.

780
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,750
Are you making some embroidery?

781
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,270
At this rate,

782
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,660
it will take you forever.

783
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,230
Let me do it.

784
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,670
You know how to treat wounds?

785
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,750
I attended first aid training.

786
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,830
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

787
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,590
You really don't want to slit the wound

788
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,990
to check for residues?

789
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,030
What if the wound heals

790
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,310
with the residue still inside?

791
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,830
Let me do it myself.

792
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,710
Eight Treasure Congee?

793
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,670
Why is it so salty?

794
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,950
Mr Zhou Chuan.

795
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,790
I'm really sorry

796
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,950
I got up late this morning

797
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,510
and did not make you breakfast.

798
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,180
Oh, right.

799
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,670
Give me the phone number
of this take-out restaurant.

800
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,990
I want to file a complaint.

801
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,700
Food has dignity too.

802
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,110
This Eight Treasure Congee
is supposed to be sweet.

803
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,910
This is salty and inedible.

804
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,070
I made this.

805
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,950
You made this?

806
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,830
Actually, it won't be salty

807
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,630
after adding hot water.

808
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,190
Then you should have more.

809
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,950
Eight Treasure Congee can boost your qi
and nourish your blood.

810
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,950
It's perfect for hard workers like you.

811
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,070
You made this congee just for me?

812
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,750
Yes.

813
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,990
I'm afraid if you work yourself to death,

814
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,390
no one can help me
hit the 350 thousand target.

815
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,550
I knew it.

816
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,470
Hello? Chief Editor Yu.

817
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,380
Really?

818
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,790
I'll tell him now.

819
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,870
Good news.

820
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,630
Pre-sales of your book starts next week.

821
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:55,300
I'll hashtag you
on all official platforms.

822
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,350
You must forward them out.

823
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,910
The more the better.

824
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,030
I'll have to pass this congee.

825
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,270
I need to go to the printing house now.

826
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,670
It's really too salty.

827
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,430
I've booked a cab for you.

828
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,270
I'll pay for it.

829
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,630
Goodbye.
