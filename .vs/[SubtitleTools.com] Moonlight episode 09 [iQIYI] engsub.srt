[Episode 09]

4
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,630
Shut the gate if the pipe broke.

5
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,030
Why are you covering it with hands?

6
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,470
What if the metal pipe broke?

7
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,060
You would've broken your hands.

8
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,590
Mr Zhou Chuan?

9
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,470
Put the clothes on first.

10
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,860
What's the matter with you?

11
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,310
Why did you return all of a sudden?

12
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,670
This is my house.

13
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,180
Can't I come back?

14
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,870
I haven't asked you.

15
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,509
What did you do to my pipe?

16
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,710
Perhaps it's broken due to

17
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,900
your sudden return.

18
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,630
Really?

19
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,710
And maybe it's because

20
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,390
I patted it lightly.

21
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,710
Patted it lightly?

22
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,310
Which rainforest

23
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,460
are you from, King Kong?

24
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,350
Pretending to be a monkey
and destroy my house.

25
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,670
Didn't you say

26
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,030
you'll be back in several days?

27
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,870
Is this the reason

28
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,430
you ran around with your pyjamas

29
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,430
and turned my bathroom into
Waterfall Cave?

30
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,790
You... You saw it?

31
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,150
I'm not blind.

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,310
Stop covering!

33
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,950
You'll smother yourself!

34
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,100
Where's your manners?

35
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,230
Look people in the eye
when they're talking to you.

36
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,350
I've seen it all anyway.

37
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,790
Just smother yourself.

38
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,950
Why are you being reasonable

39
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,310
now that you've seen it?

40
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,100
Why can't I look
if you dare to wear it?

41
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,550
I'm going back to the room and sleep.

42
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,310
Just say I'm not around

43
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,110
if someone looks for me.

44
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,190
Tell them you don't know where I went.

45
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,980
Especially if it's my father
and Jiang Yu Cheng.

46
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,430
Hold on!

47
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,430
You haven't told me

48
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,910
why you came back all of a sudden.

49
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,110
Is it because you had a fight
with your family

50
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,750
or with Mr Jiang?

51

The 30th rule of the tenancy rules.

52
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,030
All right, I'll stop asking.

53
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,670
From my experience,

54
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,990
your father must be in a bad mood.

55
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,070
Hello.

56
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,910
Hello, Mr Jiang.

57
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,620
Why do you call me at this hour?

58
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,550
Mr Jiang, I'd like to ask you.

59
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,900
What happened to Mr Zhou Chuan?

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,350
He looked upset

61
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,110
when he came back just now.

62
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,750
[He seemed to have quarrelled with
his family this afternoon.]

63
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,190
We planned to have dinner tonight

64
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,910
but he didn't come too.

65
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,910
As I expected.

66
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,350
But how did you know he went back?

67
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,230
Isn't there a location feature
in the chat software?

68
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,230
[Perhaps when we were having
conversation just now,]

69

the distance between us

70
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,990
was shortened by dozen kilometres.

71
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,910
Is there such a function?

72
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,630
Yes.

73
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,230
It's getting late.

74
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,990
Get some rest.

75
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,460
I'll stop bothering you.

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,310

are hard to communicate

and always rush her
to submit the drafts.

86

She said we even find fault with
her drafts after handing them in

87
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,510

with rejection.

You

92
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,270
can mess things up even by just

[Book of Luo He God]

Doesn't it have an overbearing impact

in comparison to those books
in the same genre?

103

[Book of Luo He God]

104
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,830
An overbearing impact.

105
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,990
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,230
It's hard for me to admire

107
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,070
your poor aesthete's taste.

108
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,630
Just explain it to me.

109
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,909
We can follow the trend.

110
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,790
This is a type of mindset.

111
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,500
Everyone is wondering

112
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,790
if Yuan Yue Publishing House
could create something unique.

113
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,909
No one has ever

114
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,030
used this traditional ink and
calligraphy as the cover.

115
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,150
It's outdated.

116
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,230
That's why no one use it.

117
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,550
It's not outdated. Why is it outdated?

118
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,870
If we only use it

119
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,230
as couplets on the cover,

120
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,870
that will be boring

121
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,390
and outdated for sure.

122
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,710
But if we use a kind of

123
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,350
special display technique,

124
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,550
then this calligraphy
can be cool as well.

125
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,670
Then have you thought about

126
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,340
the reason why you want to
use illustrations as the book cover?

127
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,270
I've thought about it.

128
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,390
It's because many readers think

129
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,940
that would fulfil their fantasy

130
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,820
if their imaginary characters

131
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,460
appear vividly on the illustrations.

132
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,510
Right.

133
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,030
Then why do you want to
break their illusion?

134
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,350
Don't you think it's cruel?

135
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,940
I'm not trying to break their illusion.

136
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,630
I just want to try
a different display technique.

137
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,020
For example, we can

138
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,780
use this calligraphy on the cover

139
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,110
and use hollow technique

140
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,750
to vaguely reveal the illustration inside.

141
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,590
It will be more
attractive with this way.

142
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,550
And it can fulfil
the readers' fantasy as well.

143
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,470
Are you here to apologise?

144
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,670
But it's too late.

145
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,300
I just went to the legal department.

146
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,950
This is the termination agreement
they drafted.

147
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,460
If you're furious with
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

148
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,950
we'll agree to terminate the agreement.

149
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,910
But we will not return the drafts

150
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,150
and we own the use-right.

151
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,230
You still have to pay us twice the fine.

152
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,590
You guys were the one to spite me

153
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,230
and you still have
the audacity to fine me?

154
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,630
Who's the one that
refused to communicate

155
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,070
and violated the contract?

156
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,670
You knew it well.

157
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,270
Do you want me to

158
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,230
remind you with the chat histories?

159
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,030
I didn't hold you to account

160
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,309
because Yuan Yue Publishing House
is a big company.

161
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,990
We don't want to waste time

162
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,110
to deal with an ordinary illustrator

163
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,660
because of some trivial matters.

164
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,630
That will dishonour

165
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,510
Yuan Yue Publishing House
and Mr Zhou Chuan.

166
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,870
Who are you scolding?

167
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,950
But it's different now.

168
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,510
You're complaining around.

169
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,310
You assaulted me

170
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,790
in every illustrator group
with your illustration.

171
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,860
Have you forgotten
the privacy terms in the contract?

172
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,950
For this reason alone,

173
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,430
I can legitimately terminate
the agreement.

174
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,750
If you did that,

175
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,950
no illustrator will be willing
to cooperate with you.

176
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,180
You don't have to care about that.

177
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,990
Mr Xia

178
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,470
has invited a famous calligrapher

179
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,550
to write an epigraph for
Mr Zhou Chuan's book.

180
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,910
I can't believe you'll use

181
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,300
calligraphy as the cover.

182
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,630
This is our official account.

183
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,870
It has been forwarded over

184
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,660
ten thousand times in a short time.

185
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,230
The readers are cheering
in the comments.

186
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,190
They said the cooperation between
Zhou Chuan and Yuan Yue Publishing House

187
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,310
is a transboundary between
emerging art and traditional art.

188
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,780
Terminating the agreement

189
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,870
won't affect us in such situation.

190
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,950
But it's different for you.

191
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,350
Soon, everyone will say that

192
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,070
we terminate your agreement

193
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,460
is due to your terrible work.

194
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,100
Tell me.

195
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,030
What do you want?

196
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,790
The second plan is

197
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,670
your drafts won't be rejected.

198
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,190
Let bygones be bygones

199
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,350
but you have to sign
a complementary agreement

200
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,750
to agree that your illustrations

201
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,790
can only be used
in the poster or inside cover.

202
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,630
Only inside cover?

203
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,510
Think about it.

204
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,220
I'll leave first as I'm busy.

205
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,590
There's a truth that
I always wanted to tell you.

206
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,900
Your ability is outstanding.

207
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,750
But I was young and ignorant

208
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,030
to like you.

209
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,630
Director Gu, it's me.

210
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,230
Director Gu,

211
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,470
what should I do?
You have to help me.

212
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,270
This is quite a major controversy.

213
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,230
Director Gu, I

214
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,830
didn't meet the deadline

215
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,790
because of you.

216
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,790
I just asked you for
the cover of Yun Fei.

217
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,780
You can't complete the job you took

218
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,350
and now you're blaming it on me.

219
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,310
It won't do me any good
if you screw up.

220
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,310
I have ways to give us an out.

221
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,070
I'll do anything you want.

222
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,910
Chu Li,

223
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,510
look, Cocoon just issued a statement.

224
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,780
She said people got the wrong idea.

225
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,910
"It has nothing to do with
the editor of Yuan Yue Publishing House."

226
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,870
"I worked well with
Yuan Yue Publishing House."

227
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,430
"We even had coffee
together this afternoon

228
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,780
and discuss about
Mr Zhou Chuan's new book."

229
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,190
She even posted the photo of the cafe.

230
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,270
It's really hard for her.

231
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,710
I guess her heart was bleeding

232
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,670
when she wrote these words.

233
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,670
[Sorry,]

Mr Xia.

241
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,830
This cover

242
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,100
is interesting. Look.

243
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,110
Monochrome calligraphy
is eye-catching

[Book of Luo He God, Zhou Chuan]

245
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,630
and Cocoon's colourful drawing

246
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,510
can be seen vaguely.

247
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,590
It's the combination
of modern and traditional.

248
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,950
I'm very satisfied.

249
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,910
This is my idea

250
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,270
but it's designed by Ah Xiang.

251
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,390
You've done a great job
in such a short time.

252
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,510
Ah Xiang,

253
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,310
I think

254
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,390
you're as good as Cocoon.

255
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,310
Youngster like you
should express yourself more.

256
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,310
Don't always hide in the back.

257
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,350
Okay, the design of this cover

258
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,230
will be settled once it's completed.

259
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,950
The next step is to collaborate with

260
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,710
the circulation department
in publicizing it.

261
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,550
Right, Chu Li.

262
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:04,070
I heard that you assured Miao and Liang

263
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,310
that you can reach the sales volume
of 350,000 for the book?

264
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,470
All right.

265
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,430
That's brave.

266
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,550
But you have to walk the talk.

267
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,710
I'll try my best, Mr Xia.

268
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,390
Oh my god!

269
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,140
Is Mr Zhou Chuan
experiencing depression?

272
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,900
Mr Zhou, what do you want
to have for dinner?

273
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,270
I don't want to eat.

274
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,540
Dinner is on the dining table.

275
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,300
Remember to eat it when you come out.

276
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,190
Mr Zhou, I've taken care
of Cocoon's cover.

277
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,750
You don't have to worry.

Open your door.

283

I said what...

285
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,870
Why don't you get up?

286
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,830
It's improper for man and
woman to be too intimate.

287
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,350

how long do you plan
to lock yourself?

295
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,150
You don't even update
your article on the internet.

296
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,230
The readers thought you went missing.

297
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,670
Do you know that cause for concern?

298
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,310
What's going on?

299
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,110
Why do you take it on all by yourself?

300
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,900
Why is your face

301
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,870
so big?

302
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,870
Right, right.

303
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,870
I know I'm a freeloader.

304
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,870
And I bother you
with the matter of publication.

305
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,150
It's true that I am bold.

306
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,180
But we live under the same roof after all.

307
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,390
We are not friends

308
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,790
but we are more than
just a nodding acquaintance.

309
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,869
I'll ask you even if you think

310
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:00,829
that I'm nosy.

311
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:02,990
What happened when you were
in your hometown?

312
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,710
What's with all those emotions?

313
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:05,940
I just asked you

314
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,349
why your face is this big.

315
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,589
I mean your facial shape

316
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,390
is big.

317
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,390
Then,

318
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,589
how about this?

319
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,710
Why are you playing dumb?

320
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,750
Can you get out?

321
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,350
I'm fine, I just want
to rest for two days.

322
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,190
Every job provides annual leaves.

323
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,870
Is that too much for a writer

324
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,070
to rest for several weeks?

325
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,980
This is not a break.

326
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,030
You're attaining mortality.

327
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,110
As your editor,

328
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,030
I can't sit there

329
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,310
and watch you ascend.

330
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,870
I don't need an editor
to worry about me.

331
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,710
How about this?

332
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,030
Let's eat out later.

333
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,030
It's my treat.

334
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,030
I know there's a restaurant nearby

335
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,470
which sells delicious beef pot.

336
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,070
Let's go.

Eat out?

00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,350
The 7th rule of the tenancy rules.

339
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,150
"No outside food as cover-up."

340
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,940
And you violated the 8th rule just now.

341
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,750
"Taking advantage of
living under the same roof

342
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,750
to do something beyond the
relationship between the landlord

and the tenant is forbidden..."

Stop!

345
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,750
The 4th rule. "Respect your landlord."

The 5th rule. "Respect..."

I'll get out first.

348

If you don't come out in half an hour,

349
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,790
I'll let Er Gou destroy this house.

Have you finished writing the book?

372
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,950
Why do you mention book
once you see me?

Go back and write it
if you haven't finished.

I refuse to.

375
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,750
Exercising makes me
feel better when writing.

376
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,990
Then just exercise near your house.

377
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,910
Don't come here.

378
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,950
The air and view here are good.

Yun Fei,

381
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,310
I'm not a young lady.

382
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,670
I know what you're thinking.

383
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,390
I'll make it clear with you.

384
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,790
This won't work for us.

385
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,950
Why won't it work?

386
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,790
You are

387
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,150
a young lady to me.

388
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,510
What's wrong with me?

389
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,870
I won't date the author.

390
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,630
Do you refuse to date an author

391
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,340
or me?

392
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,270
I heard that

393
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,390
you had

394
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,870
dated Mr Jiang Yu Cheng before.

395
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,150
Right?

396
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,430
Just ask the one

397
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,150
you heard it from.

398
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,950
Then just leave this aside.

399
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,790
What if I

400
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,110
like you?

401
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,990
I want to court you,

402
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,460
and I want to date you?

403
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,910
I have a headache.

404
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,420
Did you have a fight with your family?

405
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,630
Did Jiang Yu Cheng tell you?

406
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,670
He really has a blabbermouth.

407
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,630
No, no. He didn't say anything.

408
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,990
I just guessed it.

409
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,630
You asked me

410
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,190
if I have no childhood
or I'm heartless.

411
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,950
Why I don't miss my time as a student?

412
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,260
I really don't miss it.

413
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,590
How is it possible?

414
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,790
People like you...

415
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,980
You have good looks

416
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,150
and you're talented.

417
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,620
You're great in writing

418
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,670
and you're graduated
from top university.

419
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,270
Your school days

420
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,830
should be your finest moment.

421
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,790
Let me tell you a story about a friend.

422
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:12,910
[Father,]

423
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,790
[have you read my manuscript?]

424
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,670
[Is it all written by you?]

425
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,790
[It should have more
than 200,000 words.]

426
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,140
[I didn't count the words.]

427
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,590
[When do you start to write it?]

428
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,870
[I think I started from senior one. ]

429
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,230
[I wrote it once I had the time.]

430
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,940
[How is it?]

431
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,870
[I finally realize]

432
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,550
[the reason why your result]

433
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,630
[didn't improve]

434
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,150
[in your senior years.]

435
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,180
[You wasted your time and energy]

436
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,030
[on writing this meaningless stuff.]

437
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,550
[This stuff?]

438
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,150
[Then what kind of
stuff did you write?]

439
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,550
[What kind of attitude is that?]

440
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,990
[A man should know his place.]

441
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,950
[You've been rejected
by several publishing houses.]

442
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,190
[It wasn't for no reason.]

443
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,830
[I can hardly read]

444
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,630
[half of your manuscripts.]

445
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,100
[I don't know what you're writing!]

446
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,350
[Tell me]

447
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,030
[what you're trying to say.]

448
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,470
[Does your novel
mention any real life?]

449
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,230
[Does it have any social sense?]

450
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,910
[Does it have your own thought?]

451
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,710
[Nothing at all!]

452
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,710
[Some of them is just self-righteous]

453
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,820
[wit and pubertal venting.]

454
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,110
[A shallow novel like this
which is only for entertainment]

455
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,910
[will never be
considered as literature.]

456
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,860
[I can teach you the correct]

457
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,430
[literary writing]

458
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,060
[after your college
entrance exam ends.]

459
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,910
[I don't want to write anymore.]

460
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,100
[What does that mean?]

461
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,070
[Does the stuff you
write have any point?]

462
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,630
[You are just imposing]

463
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,990
[your value on others.]

464
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,100
[Saying that your
writing is meaningless,]

465
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,150
[this is me being gentle.]

466
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,230
[If I were to be harsh,]

467
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,870
[I would say what you write is trash!]

468
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,470
[It's a waste of papers!]

469
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,470
[Are you satisfied?]

470
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,950
No way!

471
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,710
That was cruel!

472
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,990
How could he tear his son apart

473
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,510
after working so hard to raise him?

474
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,500
Are you talking about my father or me?

475
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,030
You guys are in the same strain.

476
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,910
So,

477
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:12,230
Oriental Beauty is not
your first novel.

478
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,270
It's not. My first novel

479
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,820
was called trash by my father.

480
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,390
So, now you know why I refused to

481
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,660
sign the contract with Miao.

482
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,710
Apart from being a glib,

483
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,060
he always talks about
father-son enterprise.

484
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,230
"Mr Zhou senior must
be very proud of you."

485
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,790
"Father and son make a literary family."

486
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,990
He would say the words that I

487
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,950
hate the most in my life
within ten seconds.

488
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,630
So,

489
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,270
I could only tell him to stay out.

490
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,510
Mr Zhou Chuan, I didn't expect

491
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,340
there's such bitterness

492
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,350
behind your smile.

493
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,180
I didn't expect you can still create
Oriental Beauty, such masterpiece

494
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,350
after your maiden work was torn.

495
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,990
I really admire

496
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,070
your indomitable spirit.

497
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,150
Did you learn this

498
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,550
exaggerate expression from Miao?

499
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,700
Do I look alike?

500
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,630
Your flattering gaze isn't alike.

501
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,870
But Mr Zhou Chuan, to be honest.

502
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,470
I believe that you can get back up

503
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,750
in front of your detractors

504
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,390
after Book of Luo He God is published

505
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,550
and say aloud,

506
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,470
"Look, I did it!"

507
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,670
You can invite me if you think

508
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,990
you have insufficient aura.

509
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,870
Why are you staring at me?

510
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,790
I... I'm just thinking that

511
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,070
you look cute today.

512
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,220
But your face is big.

513
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,630
Here, here!

514
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,230
Eat a sweet ice cream when you're upset.

515
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,470
I don't want to eat it.

516
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,750
Try this ice-cream.

517
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,230
It's very delicious.

518
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,230
I don't want to.

519
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,750
It's too sweet.

520
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,430
Right, it's quite sweet.

521
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,510
Let's go home early.

522
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,750
Er Gou is waiting for us to feed him.

523
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,350
I warn you.

524
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,070
Don't engage in such
boring activity anymore.

525
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,910
Okay.

526
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,430
Sister.

527
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,910
We have a special rapport.

528
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,630
Why are you here again?

529
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,630
I'm here to court you.

530
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,150
Are you free tonight?

531
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:48,910
I'll eat with you.

532
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,430
I'm not free. I'm going somewhere.

533
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,590
I'll come with you.

534
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,790
It's a private matter.

535
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,230
I... No.

536
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,340
I'll never disturb you.

537
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,350
I'm already here, sister.

538
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,590
Get in the car.

539
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,990
So, this dictionary is published!

540
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,150
I'm not dreaming, right?

541
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,230
You're not dreaming.

542
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,390
I thought

543
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,980
once the data dictionary has launched,

544
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,910
this thing I made

545
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,380
would be completely worthless.

546
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,070
Why would it be worthless?

547
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,670
The gold will shine one day.

548
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,030
I put seven years of my life into it!

549
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,030
It's not wasted.

550
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,830
I can

551
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,310
retire comfortably now.

552
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,750
Why didn't you take Jiang with you?

553
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,110
Has he finished writing his new book?

554
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,590
His new book is already on sale.

555
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,870
He is too busy recently.

556
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,830
I'll take him to visit you
after some time.

557
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,670
Okay, okay.

558
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,030
Time to eat.

559
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,790
Let me treat you
with a cup of juice tea.

560
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,870
Then,

561
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,470
I want to tell you a good news.

562
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,470
Thanks for your juice tea.

563
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,310
What is the good news?

564
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,470
After a few days of the publication of

565
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,910
The Disappearing Amusement Park,

566
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,830
there're many letters from the readers.

567
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,430
I think it's obvious
that Mr Jiang Yu Cheng

568
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,630
will become famous again.

569
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,420
I'll be happy as long as Mr Jiang

570
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,750
could keep writing

571
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,550
new articles.

572
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,350
Then I pray for your teacher

573
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,950
to keep on writing and succeeding.
How is it?

574
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,630
Everyone come take
two movie tickets from me.

575
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,670
Movie ticket?

576
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,500
This is the perk comes with Yuan Yue.

577
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,630
There's a replay of a movie

578
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,670
about an author and an editor this week.

579
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,460
By then, you can

580
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,190
watch it with an author
who is close with you.

581
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,830
It's a chance to build
rapport with them.

582
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,510
Okay, thank you, Chief Editor.

583
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,230
Okay.

584
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,550
Thank you, Chief Editor.

585
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,630
Chu Li.

586
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,460
The respond of
Jiang Yu Cheng's serial is good.

587
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,550
This is the publishing contract of
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

588
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,180
But

589
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,310
the minimum guaranteed print run
the Marketing Department provides

590
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,790
is the same with Book of Luo He God.

591
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,950
He said since you could score this number

592
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,150
and handled Zhou Chuan, then
you can also handle Jiang Yu Cheng.

593
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,790
But the styles of these two authors

594
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,990
are totally different.

595
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,820
I know. I know.

596
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,870
It's hard.

597
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,150
But... That's why you should find a way

598
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,750
to take Mr Jiang and make him

599
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,030
sign the agreement promptly.

600
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,550
I understand.

601
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,990
I'll try my best.

602
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,710
All right.

603
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,910
Then do you want to
watch it with Mr Zhou Chuan

604
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,510
or Mr Jiang Yu Cheng?

605
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,430
Make your own decision.

606
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,100
Do you mean the movie?

607
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,870
If I invite Mr Zhou Chuan,

608
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,700
he'll tell me not to bother him

609
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,070
with such boring activity.

610
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,830
And he'll stick these two movie tickets

611
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,150
on my forehead as if they are

612
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,470
Demon Sedative Amulets.

613
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,310
Sister,

614
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,540
is Ms Liu your relative?

615
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,870
Don't ask something you shouldn't.

616
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,150
When is that dictionary

617
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,540
published?

618
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,590
Why haven't I seen it before?

619
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,940
That dictionary was planned to publish

620
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,990
but it got cancelled.

621
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,590
Ms Liu had made painstaking efforts in it.

622
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,420
She couldn't accept that

623
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,300
and had sudden cerebral haemorrhage.

624
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,110
That's why she lives here.

625
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,390
I see.

626
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:33,350
So, Ms Liu is your senior.

627
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,950
Then why was the publication cancelled?

628
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,910
Why do you have so many questions?

629
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,430
That's because I want to know you more.

630
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,030
Okay, I'll ask other people

631
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,030
if you don't want to tell me.

632
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,630
I was Ms Liu's apprentice.

633
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,990
As for the cancellation
of the publication,

634
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,310
who would buy

635
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,910
a paper dictionary nowadays?

636
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,260
The era has changed.

637
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,950
Mr Zhou Chuan.

638
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,390
The new books are on the shelf over there.

639
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,430
Okay, thank you.

640
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,670
Mr Zhou Chuan.

641
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,110
Chief Editor Yu.

642
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,750
What a coincidence!

643
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,790
Right, that's a coincidence!

644
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,700
I was talking to one of my authors.

645
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,990
Right, has Chu Li invited you?

646
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,950
Our company

647
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,270
has given out two movie tickets

648
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,630
to each person.

649
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,350
If Chu Li invites you,

650
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,670
please accept her.

651
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,670
This...

652
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,110
About the movie, I...

653
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,230
I don't really like to watch movie.

654
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,990
Why don't you ask her
to invite other person?

655
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,430
I think Chu Li must be really sincere

656
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,990
if she invites you.

657
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,630
Just consider it as a senior

658
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,580
taking the junior to edify sentiment.

659
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,510
And let her learn from you.

660
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,590
All right.

661
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,750
I'll reluctantly agree to it

662
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,590
if you say so.

663
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,470
Mr Zhou Chuan, you're a gentleman,

664
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,580
very generous.

665
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,420
I'm sorry, I've got a call.

666
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,190
I'll go to work first.

667
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,710
Go ahead.

668
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,630
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

669
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,030
Hello.

670
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,550
Just call that number will do.

671
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,550
Mr Zhou Chuan,

672
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,710
are you going to
walk the red carpet?

673
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,110
The Ideal Empire?

674
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,580
The original version of
The Ideal Empire is written in Greek.

675
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,670
You're reading the
English version which is

676
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,150
translated from the Chinese version.

677
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,180
There are two languages in between.

678
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,870
It will create biases
from the original text.

679
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,470
I suggest you

680
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,910
to read the Chinese version.

681
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,510
Those translation experts

682
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,790
are professional after all.

683
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,310
I'm going to cook now.

684
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,310
Teacher, I've drafted the agreement.

685
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,270
I'll send it to you

686
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,830
if you're free tomorrow.

687
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,870
What are you doing?

688
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,630
Who are you talking with?

689
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,510
Mr Jiang, who else would it be?

690
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,790
Tomorrow is your day off.

691
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,860
Why don't you sleep in?

692
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,790
Why do you want to send agreement?

693
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,820
Just send it to him by delivery.

694
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,910
Why do I have to send delivery
while we're living in the same city?

695
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,870
Yuan Yue Publishing House
has given me two movie tickets.

696
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,230
Let's go and watch it together

697
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,270
if you're free.

698
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,670
It's about author and editor...

699
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,219
You're going to watch
the movie with Jiang Yu Cheng?

700
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,710
Are two of you close enough
to watch movie together?

701
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,030
And Yuan Yue Publishing House

702
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,429
doesn't stipulate that
Jiang Yu Cheng must watch it.

703
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,429
It gave two movie tickets

704
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,350
for you to watch it
with anyone you like.

705
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,790
Right, Yuan Yue Publishing House
didn't stipulate

706
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,989
the person I want to watch it with.

707
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:21,989
But aren't we going out

708
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,870
together tomorrow?

709
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,190
We can watch it together then.

710
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,260
Give it back to me.

711
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,420
Then

712
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,620
what movie are you planning to watch?

713
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,670
City of Words.

714
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,429
This movie is replaying recently.

715
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:38,429
Of course I know it.

716
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,429
You know it?

717
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:42,710
Why?

718
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,590
Am I not allowed to take interest in

719
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,750
theatrical and biography movie?

720
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,270
I'm planning to watch it too.

721
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,469
You're planning to watch it?

722
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,350
So,

723
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,230
don't watch it with Jiang Yu Cheng.

724
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,750
First come, first served.

725
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,310
I said I want to watch it first.

726
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,150
It's me who stand in front of you first.

727
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,270
Isn't one of these

728
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,190
two movie tickets supposed to be mine?

729
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,110
That's not reasonable.

730
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,630
Why is it not reasonable?

731
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,110
We have the same editor.

732
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,870
Ain't I your author?

733
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,070
Yuan Yue Publishing House didn't mention

734
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,740
that you must give
this ticket to Jiang Yu Cheng.

735
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,150
Why can't you give it to me?

736
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,830
You make me feel dizzy.

737
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,550
[Okay, then see you tomorrow at noon.]

738
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,700
[I'll buy you lunch.]

739
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,270
[What do you want to eat?]

740
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,470
Let's go and watch it tonight.

741
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,510
Let's eat out and watch the movie.

742
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,350
Don't do that.

743
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,820
It's just a movie ticket.

744
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,230
It's only 38 yuan.

745
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,510
Aren't they money?

746
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,510
38 yuan is money as well.

747
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,420
How about this?

748
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,230
Both of you go and watch it.

749
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,110
I'm not going.

750
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,070
Two authors watch this kind of movie?

751
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,030
What are we going to do?

752
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,070
Complaining about

753
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,510
how unreliable the current editor is

754
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,510
or teasing each other?

755
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,790
"This drained author looks like you."

756
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,350
"The arrogant and annoying look

757
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,350
of this male lead looks familiar."

758
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,710
Okay, I surrender.

759
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,870
How about this?

760
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,350
You and Mr Jiang, each of you will get

761
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,790
one of these two free movie tickets.

762
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,990
I'll buy this movie ticket which

763
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,630
costs 38 yuan with my own money

764
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,710
and sit between you guys.

765
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,830
I won't give him a chance

766
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,950
to tease you for being arrogant.

767
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,740
And I won't give you a chance

768
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,590
to tease him for being drained.

769
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,630
That's okay, right?

770
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,070
Can you leave here

771
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,550
if there's nothing else?

772
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,590
Can you cut the potatoes

773
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,180
and beef for me

774
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,270
if you have nothing to do?

775
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,140
We're having beef
stewed with potatoes tonight.

776
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,460
I want to eat pizza

777
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,510
tomorrow at noon.

778
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,870
Ask Jiang Yu Cheng to treat us.

779
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,470
Chu Li,

780
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,750
why is he here?

781
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,670
He? He...

782
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,830
Unfortunately,

783
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,550
while you're maintaining
the relationships

784
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,790
of author and managing editor with her,

785
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,790
so am I.

786
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,510
One order of red wine
bovine tendon pizza with thin crust.

787
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,420
Extra cheese, thank you.

788
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,790
Why do you wear like this today?

789
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,670
You can only wear it out

790
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,950
if you were ten years younger.

791
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,590
I've never seen your suit too.

792
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,030
Why? Did you buy it last night

793
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,390
and ask for urgent delivery?

794
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,110
Aren't we here to watch movie?

795
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,230
Why do you wear

796
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,070
like a playboy?

797
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,910
This is to respect the lady.

798
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,590
Who would be like you?

799
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,590
As if you were going to
walk the red carpet of the Oscars.

800
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,070
I look formal with whatever I wear.

801
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,310
I can't help it too.

802
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,510
I'm frustrated too.

803
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,270
I want to eat chicken pizza.

804
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,950
I'm sorry, Chu Li.

805
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,790
It's easy to be childish

806
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,350
when being with someone.

807
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,270
Follow her orders.

808
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,150
And extra cheese.

809
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,260
[City of Words]

810
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,750
Chu Li.

811
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,460
You eat snack after having meal?

812
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,710
Is your stomach an abyss?

813
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,430
I'm full that

814
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,660
I'm almost puke as the pizza is huge.

815
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,990
That's because
you've eaten too much, okay?

816
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,550
I...

817
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,180
Here.

818
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,030
Thank you, Mr Jiang.

819
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,030
It's all sweet.

820
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,790
Are you treating her like a child?

821
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,980
Have you heard a saying?

822
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,990
Gift blind the eyes.

823
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,790
I'm helping you to
accommodate the awkwardness

824
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,990
in case your food is wasted.

825
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,310
Didn't you just have meal?

826
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,190
Why are you eating again?

827
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,030
I just ate a small piece.

828
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,910
You're heavy enough.

829
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,430
You...

830
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,670
Why do you say something this harsh?

831
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,950
I tell you what.

832
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,030
If Er Gou was a female,

833
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,230
he would have left the house.

834
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,270
Thanks for speaking up, Mr Jiang.

835
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,020
Someone is really poor

836
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,590
as he's mooching meals.

837
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,100
You even want to
treat us dinner after lunch.

838
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,190
Are you thinking that you're rich?

839
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,310
I suggest you to transfer it
to my bank card.

840
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,590
I want to treat Chu Li to dinner

841
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,820
not you.

842
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,030
I'm just planning to

843
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,590
go to the same restaurant.

844
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,390
I didn't say I'm going to mooch meals.

845
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,150
I'm not telling you
which restaurant we booked.

846
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,590
Then I insist to follow you

847
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,790
and see which restaurant you go.

848
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,990
Why don't we go back home

849
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,230
and have our own meal?

850
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,380
I agree.

851
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,630
I have someone to prepare
three meals for me anyway.

852
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,590
You've hire a new maid?

853
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,550
And you have the audacity

854
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,830
to follow us?

855
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,230
You must be rich then.

856
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,510
I didn't hire a cooking maid.

857
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,990
She even walks the dog, writes
and watches television with me.

858
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,110
Who is that unfortunate

859
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,270
to become your girlfriend?

860
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,870
It's said that the cover illustrator of
Book of Luo He God

861
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,670
has a crush on you.

862
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,430
The time matches too.

863
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,430
Is it really Cocoon?

864
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,110
Am I blind?

865
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,980
Then who is she?

866
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,550
[Watch your mouth and your language.]

867
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,400
[Little Monkey]

868
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,870
[Beware of ruining my innocence.

869
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,590
Is your girlfriend looking for you?

870
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,230
Go home and accompany her.

871
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,670
Do you think I like to
follow you around?

872
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,890
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour]

873
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,230
[Go home with me.]

874
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,310
Mr Zhou Chuan, goodbye.

875
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,390
Be careful on the way home.

876
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,390
He really left.

877
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,840
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour]

878
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,310
Mr Jiang,

879
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,950
can we talk about
the publication contract?

880
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,630
Mr Jiang, take a look.

881
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,870
The number in the agreement

882
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,310
is the same with Zhou Chuan's
Book of Luo He God.

883
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,750
But...

884
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,550
I'm sorry, Chu Li.

885
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,670
I think you know

886
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,990
what I'm going to say.

887
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,070
I, too, know

888
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,350
what you're going to say.

889
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,710
It doesn't matter that the minimum
guaranteed print run is less.

890
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,430
What matters is Yuan Yue
Publishing House can sell it.

891
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,590
As long as the sales
of this book is high,

892
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,190
then you'll pay me a reasonable royalty,

893
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:46,990
right?

894
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,790
Did you convince
Zhou Chuan with the same way?

895
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,510
Seems like Mr Zhou Chuan
has complaint to you.

896
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,590
Of course,

897
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,790
there're many other reasons.

898
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,830
Zhou Chuan

899
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,030
is arrogant

900
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,500
and has Eighth Grader Syndrome.

901
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,230
Perhaps he's full of ego too.

902
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,270
He's willing to sign
Book of Luo He God over to you.

903
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,190
It's more of

904
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,510
having self-confidence

905
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,150
than having faith in you.

906
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,140
You're right.

907
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,190
I know that.

908
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,030
But I'm different.

909
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,510
About The Disappearing Zoo,

910
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,070
I've created a miracle
in the sales volume

911
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,790
of rookies in the publishing industry.

912
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,470
For the second and third series,

913
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,270
each of them was
the famous book for everyone.

914
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,990
They were placed on
the best-seller spot in every bookstore.

915
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,630
But the fact is

916
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,830
every book I wrote has been

917
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:40,990
in downward trend since then.

918
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,340
Those two books that
I recently published

919
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,100
have poor sales too.

920
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,300
I can't afford to lose.

921
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,150
Mr Jiang.

922
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,030
But I've said that

923
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,990
I'll give you a chance.

924
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,990
What chance?

925
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,900
Please give me a satisfying figure
after Zhou Chuan's

926
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,390
Book of Luo He God is published.

927
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,070
Like you said before,

928
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,510
prove it to me.

929
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,670
Let me see

930
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,580
your value as an editor.

931
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:19,590
If you can't even handle
a famous author

932
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,860
like Zhou Chuan,

933
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,390
then don't even think about

934
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,150
helping someone like me.

935
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,630
It's embarrassing to talk about

936
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,990
the sales volume and

937
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,100
the terms of royalty

938
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,790
in front of my fan.

939
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:44,740
Do you feel disillusioned?

940
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,470
No, I don't feel that way.

941
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,830
I'm different from Zhou Chuan.

942
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,750
Right, you guys are quite different.

943
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,470
He only wants to write happily.

944
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,190
For me, I want more.

945
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:08,470
Mr Zhou Chuan publishes
his book with rage.

946
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,590
He wants to show that his father

947
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,140
was wrong with his achievement.

948
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,070
You've shifted with the market
from the beginning.

949
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,310
You're the chosen one,

950
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:17,630
a best-selling author.

951
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,430
Everyone gets what they need.

952
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,310
There's neither lowliness nor nobleness.

953
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,830
Being a commercial author
is nothing to be ashamed of.

954
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,420
If you have no desire

955
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,390
to write,

956
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,500
then things you write
will never be a big seller.

957
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,790
Moreover, I've seen it.

958
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,230
You are genuine when writing this book.
