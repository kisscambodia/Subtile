00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:05,796
RECORD OF YOUTH

2
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,358
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS AN
"EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT" AND IS SUPPORTED

3
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:09,045
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, TOURISM
AND THE KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

4
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,238
You can come in.

5
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:44,171
You look so shy.

6
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,550
Right?
I feel a little shy for some reason.

7
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:51,470
Just be your usual self. This is awkward.

8
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:02,356
-Is this you?
-Yes.

9
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:03,857
Do you want some tea?

10
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:12,240
Today's my lucky day.

11
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:14,910
Was I always that mean to you?

12
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:16,536
Come on. This is nothing.

13
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:19,873
Thanks.

14
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:21,750
For what?

15
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,543
For reaching out to me
when you needed someone.

16
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,929
I crossed the line
because I had a tough day.

17
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:36,807
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called you.

18
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:47,109
Don't get the wrong idea. I'm nice to you
because you're his girlfriend.

19
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,443
That's all this is.

20
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:52,280
What's with you?

21
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:54,116
Why do you assume I like you?

22
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:58,161
Forget it, then. I was really worried.

23
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:00,831
Of course, why would you like me?

24
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,210
Aren't you hungry?

25
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:06,962
I always have meat in the fridge.

26
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:09,965
I am, but I shouldn't.
I have a shoot tomorrow.

27
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,301
Won Hae-hyo is a man
who thinks about tomorrow.

28
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:14,720
Impressive.

29
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:21,810
HYE-JUN

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,401
Hey.

31
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:32,654
Did you call me? I'm in Singapore now.

32
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:34,698
Sorry, I was on the plane.

33
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:35,907
<i>I see.</i>

34
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:38,618
Did something happen?

35
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:40,954
No, I just wanted to talk.

36
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,666
What are you up to now?

37
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,795
How about a long phone chat?

38
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,340
<i>You should be well-rested
for your fan meet-up event.</i>

39
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:56,678
I miss you.

40
00:02:58,263 --> 00:02:59,181
Me too.

41
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:16,156
EPISODE 13

42
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:20,202
That was Hye-jun.

43
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:22,329
I know.

44
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:23,705
I didn't tell him about you.

45
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:26,208
He'd be upset to know
that we're together this late.

46
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:28,835
You're very considerate of him.

47
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:32,506
Because he's doing his best too.

48
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:37,427
I actually called him before I called you.

49
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:39,137
He didn't pick up.

50
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,389
So I'm his stand-in?

51
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:43,892
You know, it was like,

52
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:47,479
"I have someone else to call
even if you aren't around."

53
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,523
But as soon as I called you,
I regretted it.

54
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:50,816
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:56,113
I wouldn't have come had I not wanted to.

56
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:01,618
Feel free to keep using me
for your beautiful relationship.

57
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,250
Do Hye-jun and I need to use someone
to maintain our relationship?

58
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:11,795
Hey, don't take it so seriously.

59
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,589
Life is serious. It's no joking matter.

60
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:28,736
RECORD OF YOUTH

61
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:37,904
I knew it.

62
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:39,906
You can't live without me.

63
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:46,246
LEE JI-NA - JIN SEO-U

64
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:50,792
YOON JEONG-HU - SA HYE-JUN

65
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:53,795
Cut. Let's take a quick break.

66
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,297
FROM LOVERS TO FRIENDS

67
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,465
It sure is awkward to do scenes like this.

68
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:59,467
FRIENDS SINCE MODELING DAYS

69
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:02,012
SEO-U
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER

70
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:04,347
THEY HAVE GREAT CHEMISTRY

71
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:05,432
BICKERING
SQUABBLING

72
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:06,641
THEY ARE ALL SMILES

73
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:08,435
SEO-U AND HYE-JUN ARE SHY
REHEARSING

74
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:09,895
LOVEY-DOVEY

75
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:11,104
ACTION

76
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:12,105
JEONG-HU AND JI-NA

77
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:16,151
JEONG-HU AND JI-NA
FROM DRAMA TO ROMANTIC COMEDY

78
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:23,533
WE'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD
TO THE COUPLE'S ON-SCREEN CHEMISTRY

79
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:31,333
SA HYE-JUN AND JIN SEO-U ARE DATING

80
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,542
I can't believe this.

81
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:35,795
Now we have scandals round-the-clock.

82
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,922
This is nuts.

83
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:41,843
I must get a rebuttal article released
before Hye-jun arrives.

84
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:44,387
FEUD OVER CHARLIE JUNG'S INHERITANCE

85
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:52,729
Su-man.

86
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:56,024
You've lost so many exclusives.

87
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,525
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,319
You can't let this keep happening.

89
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:02,113
I get that you couldn't cover
Hye-jun and Seo-u.

90
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:04,240
But you had the exclusive
on him and Charlie Jung.

91
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:06,826
-Why let them steal it?
-I've been following up on it.

92
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,161
Keep digging into Hye-jun.

93
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:10,705
It seems anything about him goes viral.

94
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,128
I'm working on an exclusive about him
dating a makeup artist.

95
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:20,131
A makeup artist?
That's not exclusive enough.

96
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:22,258
These photos are nothing.

97
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:24,135
What's with you?

98
00:06:24,678 --> 00:06:27,430
You can talk about this on TV shows
using initials.

99
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:28,890
Do we only care about facts?

100
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:32,519
A fact can be seen differently
depending on the angle.

101
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,032
SA HYE-JUN DENIES DATING RUMORS
WITH JIN SEO-U

102
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:50,203
Do we have about 30 minutes
until the shoot?

103
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:52,122
Do you want to make a stop?

104
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:13,268
Why are you so surprised?

105
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:14,811
Didn't you say you had a shoot?

106
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,521
I'm just stopping by.

107
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:19,441
Can you do my hair and makeup?

108
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,235
I can't. My client will be here shortly.

109
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:27,115
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:28,450
Why are you always sorry?

111
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,160
You say that way too often.

112
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:31,870
Do I?

113
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:35,498
What are you sorry about? Let's hear it.

114
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:41,129
Jin Seo-u and I are just friends,
nothing more than that.

115
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:43,506
I never asked.

116
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:46,009
Haven't you read the article?

117
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,012
About me dating…

118
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:54,434
The article about me and Seo-u.

119
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:59,022
Because the drama is such a hit,
there are articles about you every day.

120
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:03,234
I've stopped reading them altogether.
It's not good for my mental health.

121
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:04,778
That's great.

122
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:07,906
There are dating rumors?

123
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:15,455
It's Chi-yeong. He's telling me to hurry.

124
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:18,917
I'm coming.

125
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:25,757
I trust you.

126
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:30,428
I only believe what I see
with my own eyes and what you tell me,

127
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,389
so don't let it get to you.

128
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,435
Let's have dinner with my mom.

129
00:08:38,228 --> 00:08:40,605
She wants to treat you.

130
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,774
Really? Why?

131
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:46,152
What do you think?
Because her son loves you.

132
00:08:57,414 --> 00:08:59,165
No answer, again.

133
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:04,462
Why won't you give me any work, Jang-man?

134
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,973
-Going to work?
-Yes.

135
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:17,725
I have a shoot tomorrow.
Do you want to come with me?

136
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:20,728
-Why would I?
-I'll split the pay with you in half.

137
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,731
Just keep it for yourself.

138
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:37,787
You look so excited.

139
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,499
Isn't Hye-jun heading straight
to the shoot?

140
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,584
Is he coming home?

141
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,669
He will, even if it's late.
This is his home.

142
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,921
Don't you have work?

143
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,966
Me? Yes, I should head out.

144
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:52,635
Is the business slow
because of the economy?

145
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:54,762
No, I'm headed to Jang-man's place now.

146
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:01,102
We should never rely on
Hye-jun financially.

147
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,022
Let's make sure
we can always support ourselves.

148
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,149
Of course. Why state the obvious?

149
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:07,734
I'm afraid we might get swayed.

150
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:09,652
Don't people ask you?

151
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:13,406
Everyone's been telling me,
"Hard times are over.

152
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,033
Ask him to open a store for you.

153
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:17,911
What did Hye-jun buy you?
How much did he give you?

154
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:19,120
Why didn't you move

155
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,956
across the street
instead of buying this house?

156
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,918
The price will skyrocket
once redeveloped. Lucky you.

157
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:27,462
You can live comfortably now."
They're all jealous.

158
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,798
I don't want them to bad-mouth Hye-jun,
so I stay quiet.

159
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:32,926
Me too.

160
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:36,221
Parents should give to their children,
and take from them.

161
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:39,766
I was worried he couldn't support himself,

162
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:42,143
and I'm happy
I no longer have to worry about it.

163
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:46,564
Let's never change the way
we feel about this.

164
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:54,489
<i>My heart hasn't changed,
but my reality has.</i>

165
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,992
<i>Jang-man!</i>

166
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,746
It's been a while since
we last ate together like this.

167
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,790
Dad, this is called "brunch."

168
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:05,875
It's breakfast-lunch.

169
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,002
It's because none of us works nine to six.

170
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:10,171
Why didn't you go to work today?

171
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:11,839
I've learned enough.

172
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:15,134
I want to open my own studio.

173
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:16,886
-Did you quit?
-No, not yet.

174
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,014
If you want to do it,
get started when I can still help you.

175
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:21,432
-Really?
-Are you crazy?

176
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:25,353
It's a bad idea at a time like this.
Receiving salaries is the best.

177
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:28,898
I feel like I'm falling behind.

178
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:32,068
Hye-jun's a superstar now,
and Hae-hyo is steadily successful.

179
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:34,320
So you're the loser among your friends.

180
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:44,247
That's because I take after you.

181
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,916
Joining his fan club
doesn't make you his mom.

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,128
You're the loser Jin-u's mom.

183
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:52,130
Jin-u, you won.

184
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:55,550
Gosh! Yeong-nam is here.

185
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,510
Tell him I'm not here.

186
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,178
You can't keep avoiding him.

187
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:01,097
-Just tell him!
-How?

188
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,224
What's going on?
Who are you trying to avoid?

189
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:05,059
-It's…
-<i>Are you going to keep this up?</i>

190
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:06,769
Why won't you give me any work?

191
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:11,024
Yeong-nam, I understand
your feelings might be hurt.

192
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,651
But you will thank me down the road.

193
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:16,362
I can still check the floor plans
and do simple stuff.

194
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:18,448
Not working will stress me out even more.

195
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:20,408
Just change the way you think.

196
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:23,244
Why can't you get help from your son?

197
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:26,039
People will speak ill of Hye-jun
if you get hurt on the job.

198
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:27,665
All eyes are on him now.

199
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:30,043
Everyone wants to see
what he'll do for you.

200
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,712
I can't spend his money.

201
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,214
As you know, I never helped him
establish his career.

202
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:38,134
Who did he get his looks from?

203
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:40,178
Is he the only good actor in this country?

204
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,138
Don't you dare criticize him.

205
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:46,559
Clearly, he didn't get his good looks
from me.

206
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,770
It was you who married Ae-suk.

207
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:51,314
And he's tall because of your father.

208
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:52,690
Enough!

209
00:12:52,774 --> 00:12:54,776
-Will you give me work or not?
-I won't!

210
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:58,946
You can't keep your old ways.

211
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:00,740
You're Sa Hye-jun's dad.

212
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,700
People are so nosy.

213
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,869
Why are people so interested
in others' lives?

214
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,121
Celebrity gossip is like
talking about your neighbors.

215
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:09,165
There's nothing wrong

216
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:11,751
with worrying about someone
and finding solace in it.

217
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,462
Look up Hye-jun,
and you'll find so many articles daily.

218
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,339
Even today, a dating rumor broke out.

219
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:18,091
But it's all fake.

220
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,468
How is finding solace in fake news nice?

221
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:27,767
Hae-hyo should have gotten that role.

222
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:37,902
They're airing reruns of Hye-jun's drama.

223
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:41,030
His drama made it big again.
<i>The First Human</i>.

224
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:42,865
Mom, I'm in that drama too.

225
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:46,119
I know. The drama is a huge hit,

226
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,287
but not you.

227
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,623
The writers are the problem.

228
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:53,292
Until when will they keep focusing
on the lead characters?

229
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:56,587
I'm getting many offers too,
even for lead roles.

230
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:01,676
I guess you don't check
the scripts I get these days.

231
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:05,138
I don't feel as determined anymore.

232
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:06,848
I've lost my motivation.

233
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:09,809
Try to believe in your son, Mom.

234
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:14,605
You're so handsome.
Why aren't things taking off for you?

235
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,816
Do you want to see this?

236
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,330
This is my absolute favorite
out of all the things you've done.

237
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:33,207
It's a commercial.

238
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,293
Who cares? You look amazing in it.

239
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:39,464
OUR YOUTH ISN'T OVER YET

240
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:43,176
-Where are you going?
-Do-ha wants to meet up.

241
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:47,722
I don't like him because
he reminds me of Lee Tae-su.

242
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:49,432
You don't have to see him anymore.

243
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,685
Lee Tae-su

244
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:56,522
won't leave us alone until he decides

245
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:58,608
that he doesn't need us.

246
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:04,697
What now?

247
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,825
Did you look into it?
Hae-hyo's follower count.

248
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:09,952
You're so persistent.

249
00:15:10,036 --> 00:15:11,621
Give me something and I'll shut up.

250
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:15,041
Look. I'd say it's suspicious
if the number of comments

251
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:16,667
wasn't on par with his follower count.

252
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:20,421
Also if most of the likes are
from foreign accounts

253
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:23,633
and if he starts getting likes
as soon as he posts something.

254
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:26,093
And? Hae-hyo's follower count
is fake, right?

255
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:29,096
I don't know. There's no solid evidence.

256
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,598
Why don't you look into it?

257
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,433
I just gave you some pointers.

258
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,395
Where are you going?

259
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,105
A reporter wants to meet.

260
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:39,273
You…

261
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,276
I'm doing it for you.

262
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:52,078
Food is the best remedy for stress.

263
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,997
You've had a number of exclusives.
Why are you stressed?

264
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:57,375
My boss gave me an earful
for losing a couple.

265
00:15:58,084 --> 00:16:00,878
I had another exclusive
on Sa Hye-jun's girlfriend,

266
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:03,005
but my boss rejected it
saying it's too weak.

267
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,132
-Who is she?
-A makeup artist.

268
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:06,759
I have photos.

269
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:09,887
I called his agent at JJamppong,
and she flat out denied it.

270
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:16,978
Any agent would have done the same.

271
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:21,816
You're such a wonderful person.

272
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,901
She betrayed you,
yet you're defending her.

273
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:25,862
Come on. It wasn't that bad.

274
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:27,822
Anyway, what kinds of photos?

275
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,366
I have them on my phone.
I'll show you later.

276
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,952
Don't you have to go
to the police station?

277
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,537
I'm still working on Charlie Jung.

278
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:38,457
He was dating an actor,
and they've been feuding over his assets.

279
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,294
What do you think people want to know?

280
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:45,089
It's who he used to date.

281
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:47,550
YOON JEONG-HU

282
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,468
I've received the data you sent.

283
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:52,513
But I can't make the investment decisions
with just that.

284
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:54,974
So, please provide more options.

285
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:57,101
<i>Okay, Mr. Yoon.</i>

286
00:16:57,184 --> 00:17:01,564
<i>I'll send you supplementary materials,
so please reconsider.</i>

287
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,190
Okay.

288
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:12,074
Cut! Okay, next scene.

289
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,957
Good job. That was great.

290
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,876
Here's the next scene.

291
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,503
<i>Who is Charlie's boyfriend?</i>

292
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:27,882
Look at you getting straight to the point.
I can't tell you.

293
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,967
Just tell me, please!

294
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:31,218
I'm really stressed out.

295
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:33,054
Why dig into a closed case?

296
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,805
People are not ready to let it go yet.

297
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:37,516
It's Sa Hye-jun, right?

298
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:39,352
No.

299
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:40,853
Of course, you'd say no.

300
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,772
I know that it's Sa Hye-jun.

301
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,774
That's why you interviewed him first.

302
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,692
I told you it's not him. Sa Hye-jun…

303
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,530
We only interviewed him
because of the call history

304
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:52,990
and text messages.

305
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:54,116
Leave now, will you?

306
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:55,910
What did the texts say?

307
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,411
Was he the last one who called?

308
00:17:57,495 --> 00:17:58,412
I said no!

309
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:01,916
A strong no means yes.

310
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,508
MODELING AGENCY CONTRACT

311
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,927
CONTRACT DURATION

312
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:15,429
Come in.

313
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,688
Can't you afford to move now?

314
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,816
What did Su-man say?

315
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:29,610
Gosh, you're so impatient.
Here's the bread you like.

316
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,946
I don't like them anymore.

317
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,156
But you got them for me, so I'll accept.

318
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,828
May I sit down?

319
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,247
Of course.
It's unlike you to ask such a question.

320
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:45,251
I've changed.
When you're well-off, you become relaxed.

321
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,795
And that helps you
become more understanding.

322
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,089
Sure, although it makes no sense.

323
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:52,216
You shouldn't treat me like this.

324
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,052
Do you know what I did for Hye-jun today?

325
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:56,804
I hope you didn't sabotage him.

326
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,305
So he's dating a makeup artist.

327
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,057
-Jeez!
-They even have photos.

328
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:04,395
Photos?

329
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,064
What kinds of photos?

330
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:09,775
Well, you know…

331
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,571
<i>A kiss?</i>

332
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:17,199
Will they publish it?

333
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:19,160
I talked them out of it.

334
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,872
-Why?
-I want to get along with Hye-jun.

335
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,333
-Okay, do that.
-Put in a good word for me.

336
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,627
And can you also arrange a meeting?

337
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,671
It'd be nice to work together.

338
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,048
Better the devil you know.

339
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,176
It's better to be duped
by the same person.

340
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:38,345
If you're duped by someone else,
you will never trust anyone.

341
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,684
He's a superstar now.

342
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:46,312
Even so, he's still the contractor
on his contract.

343
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:49,565
It was for a year, so the contract is up.
And we're about to renew it.

344
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,903
I see.

345
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,780
That's right. I see the wheels turning.

346
00:19:56,572 --> 00:20:01,327
Looks like you're convinced
that he'll stay with you.

347
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,661
You never know.

348
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:04,830
But I know that he won't sign with you.

349
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,625
He has a brother, right? What does he do?

350
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:15,841
-Mr. Sa.
-Yes?

351
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:17,259
A VIP client is here.

352
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:19,261
What about it?

353
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:20,679
I thought he was your client.

354
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,525
Oh, hello.

355
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,568
-Hello.
-Yes.

356
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,574
I'm Lee Tae-su, Hye-jun's former manager
from his modeling days.

357
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:43,160
I'm currently with A June Entertainment.

358
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:45,079
I see. Take a seat.

359
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:46,539
Thank you.

360
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:49,500
I'll give you two some privacy then.

361
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:53,254
What?

362
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:02,471
You're charming too,
but in a different way.

363
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,474
I'm charming indeed.

364
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:08,602
It's just that my looks are
never judged fairly because of Hye-jun.

365
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:10,646
Right, I get it.

366
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,691
He bragged about you a lot.
He said you're very smart.

367
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:17,778
He'd never do that.
You don't have to flatter me.

368
00:21:17,862 --> 00:21:19,071
<i>I like this guy.</i>

369
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:25,119
Hye-jun is very dear to me.

370
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:29,707
We went through a lot together
when I ran the modeling agency,

371
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:32,960
but I couldn't do much for him.

372
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,005
That's why I let him sign with Min-jae.

373
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,008
Then how did A June…

374
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:40,801
We were bought out.

375
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:42,595
They acquired my agency.

376
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:45,931
I got some shares in return.
The conditions were pretty good.

377
00:21:46,015 --> 00:21:48,851
I heard you weren't doing well,
but you managed to sell the company.

378
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,269
After Hye-jun left,

379
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,439
I worked very hard to grow the company.

380
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:56,191
Now, I can give him
all the support he needs.

381
00:21:58,027 --> 00:21:59,945
But why are you telling me all this?

382
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:02,448
You're his brother.

383
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:07,453
I know how much he loves his family.

384
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,288
Right, I know what you mean.

385
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:13,292
That being said… This is a gift card.

386
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,545
I couldn't help Hye-jun before,
so I'd like to give this to you instead.

387
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:22,176
A June is one of the top five
entertainment agencies.

388
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,803
We have an account at this bank,
so I'm sure you know.

389
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,932
Hye-jun is a superstar.

390
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,935
He should receive
the kind of care that he deserves.

391
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,978
You're smarter than he is.

392
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:34,271
Gosh, please.

393
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,231
I got better grades in school.

394
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:40,069
JJamppong relies on him,
but we're different.

395
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:44,698
We can pay him a lot for signing with us.

396
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:51,080
A JUNE ENTERTAINMENT
DIRECTOR LEE TAE-SU

397
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:11,016
You're not working out. Why are you here?

398
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,018
-What are you looking at?
-Hae-hyo.

399
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:15,771
I liked you.

400
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:20,234
I guess I had a fantasy about those
born with a silver spoon.

401
00:23:20,818 --> 00:23:21,819
What do you mean?

402
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,446
Your parents aren't just rich.

403
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,240
They're both very well-educated.

404
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,909
That's why I wanted to befriend you.

405
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:36,041
I came this far on my own.

406
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,835
Right, so did I.

407
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:41,213
Did you know that you can pay
to increase the number of followers?

408
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:43,090
-Really?
-You didn't know?

409
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:46,343
But you see, I had a hard time
believing your follower count was real.

410
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:48,762
So I looked into it.

411
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,266
Looked into what?

412
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:55,144
I think it's fake.
I have circumstantial evidence.

413
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:58,647
If you didn't do it,
maybe it was your mom?

414
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,315
How dare you.

415
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,527
This only made me realize
that I should love myself more.

416
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:04,987
Thanks, friend.

417
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:09,992
We aren't friends yet.
You're just an acquaintance to me.

418
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,329
Thanks for your help.

419
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:17,291
-But that's it.
-I don't like you anymore either.

420
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,266
-Good job today.
-Good job.

421
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,397
Drop me off and go home.

422
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:42,232
Ms. Lee wants to see you.

423
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,698
I sued another group
of hate commenters today.

424
00:24:49,782 --> 00:24:52,326
The police probably called the ones
we sued already.

425
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:56,330
We caught the one who posted
mean comments everywhere.

426
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,709
We'll see a lawyer tomorrow.

427
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,420
-What is this?
-Your contract.

428
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:06,924
What I hate the most
is using personal connections for work.

429
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:08,926
Same here.

430
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:13,347
Don't look tough. I'm nervous.

431
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,557
If you say you'll leave,
I'll beg you not to.

432
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,685
I'd choose <i>jjajangmyeon</i> over <i>jjamppong</i>.

433
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,980
No, <i>jjamppong</i> is better than <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

434
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:23,524
End of story.

435
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:33,620
<i>Your takeaway from this</i>

436
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:37,457
<i>should be the fact that I'm willing to do
the things I hate for your sake.</i>

437
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:41,002
I was the one who stepped in
when the director and the producer

438
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:43,755
were wondering who to cast
for <i>Normal Person</i>.

439
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:48,134
And the numbers of followers
on social media you're so proud of?

440
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,780
Are you out? Can you talk now?

441
00:26:09,614 --> 00:26:10,949
Yes, I'm just driving.

442
00:26:11,574 --> 00:26:14,160
I'm meeting Lee Hae-ji,
the actress you introduced me to.

443
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:16,913
<i>She was so nice
because you spoke highly of me.</i>

444
00:26:17,497 --> 00:26:18,706
That's great.

445
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,209
Are you upset about something?

446
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:25,046
-No.
<i>-Cheer up.</i>

447
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:28,716
<i>The First Human</i> is a hit.
You're in it, so you're a hotshot now.

448
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,469
-Is that supposed to make me feel better?
-Yes, it is.

449
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:35,223
Next time, do a better job.
And be sure to impress Hae-ji.

450
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:38,852
I will so that I don't embarrass you.

451
00:26:38,935 --> 00:26:41,312
I don't care. Just be yourself.

452
00:26:44,274 --> 00:26:46,192
So that's how I should have consoled you.

453
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:49,112
Thanks.

454
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:52,240
<i>And I'm sorry
because you always help me out.</i>

455
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:53,616
<i>I'll repay you.</i>

456
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,618
Turn to me when you really need help.

457
00:26:58,705 --> 00:26:59,831
That won't happen.

458
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,931
<i>Why are you so excited
about your follower count?</i>

459
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:18,433
Why am I so excited?

460
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:21,561
I have one million followers
who are my fans.

461
00:27:21,644 --> 00:27:24,939
Numbers like that are fake.
Do you want to know what's real?

462
00:27:25,815 --> 00:27:28,109
Being applauded on stage like Hye-jun.

463
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:29,277
Darn it!

464
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:45,043
Mom.

465
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:48,338
-Are you going out?
-To see your aunt.

466
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:49,464
I want something casual.

467
00:27:51,341 --> 00:27:52,717
-Where are you going?
-A date.

468
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:56,262
I'm trying to enjoy my dating life
like you suggested.

469
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:58,681
Then why tell me?

470
00:27:58,765 --> 00:28:00,350
I always tell you where I'm going.

471
00:28:02,268 --> 00:28:04,395
Don't test my patience.

472
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:06,231
I've conceded a lot.

473
00:28:06,314 --> 00:28:07,774
I'll see you later.

474
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:13,738
Gosh, that brat.

475
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:18,409
Go on in.

476
00:28:22,163 --> 00:28:24,624
-Did you eat?
-I did, of course.

477
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:26,960
Gosh, I'm home.

478
00:28:27,043 --> 00:28:28,753
Home sweet home.

479
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:30,672
Don't you love your room?

480
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:33,591
I love it. I don't ever want to leave.

481
00:28:36,177 --> 00:28:37,262
I'm sorry.

482
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,271
You say that to me
whenever you see me now.

483
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,064
I know, right?

484
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:51,067
I don't know why I feel sorry
whenever I see you these days.

485
00:28:55,196 --> 00:28:57,156
-Mom.
-Yes?

486
00:28:59,617 --> 00:29:03,496
When two women came into my life,
my life took a new turn.

487
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:05,665
<i>That's Jeong-ha and me.</i>

488
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:07,333
Min-jae and Jeong-ha.

489
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:11,921
-Not Jeong-ha and me?
-Why would you be one of them?

490
00:29:13,965 --> 00:29:16,885
Right. You grew up on your own.

491
00:29:17,427 --> 00:29:19,846
Mom, you're my mom.

492
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:22,181
You already have a place in my heart.

493
00:29:23,433 --> 00:29:25,852
Right? I'm your mom.

494
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:27,020
What were you thinking?

495
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:30,899
I feel like I don't deserve you.

496
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:32,775
I saw how Hae-hyo's mom supported him.

497
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:34,944
And what I did for you
doesn't even come close.

498
00:29:35,945 --> 00:29:38,406
By the way, why did you talk to Ms. Lee
about Jeong-ha?

499
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:42,535
We barely get to spend time.

500
00:29:43,578 --> 00:29:44,454
I feel bad.

501
00:29:45,788 --> 00:29:47,874
Should I spend time with her
in your place?

502
00:29:47,957 --> 00:29:49,167
That won't be the same.

503
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,169
Right.

504
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:53,421
Did you tell her I'll treat her to a meal?

505
00:29:54,255 --> 00:29:55,715
I did. She seemed happy.

506
00:29:56,382 --> 00:29:57,508
Then, let's pick a date.

507
00:30:15,652 --> 00:30:17,153
Hello, Hye-jun.

508
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:49,477
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT SA HYE-JUN

509
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,062
That jerk left another comment.

510
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:54,524
Why can't this jerk let him be?
He's everywhere.

511
00:30:57,485 --> 00:30:58,987
I'll follow you to the end.

512
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:03,866
I BET YOU'RE CHARLIE'S LOVER

513
00:31:09,163 --> 00:31:10,915
Hye-jun!

514
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:13,209
Yes. I'm in here.

515
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,964
I need to talk to you. Should I wait?

516
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:22,135
Let's talk.

517
00:31:26,264 --> 00:31:27,348
Gosh, the material…

518
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:32,770
What is it about?

519
00:31:32,854 --> 00:31:36,149
I met with Mr. Lee Tae-su
from A June Entertainment.

520
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:37,775
You were in his modeling agency.

521
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,072
-Why?
-His agency has accounts with our bank.

522
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:47,869
By the way,
he seemed to be really competent.

523
00:31:48,536 --> 00:31:50,580
He was sorry
he couldn't help you more before.

524
00:31:50,663 --> 00:31:52,749
He wants to work with you again.

525
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,208
He gave me a gift card, too.

526
00:31:55,334 --> 00:31:56,627
Did you take it?

527
00:31:58,087 --> 00:31:59,672
-What if I did?
-Why did you?

528
00:31:59,756 --> 00:32:01,257
Do you know how he treated me?

529
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,634
How would I when you never told me?

530
00:32:03,718 --> 00:32:05,511
Signing with a better agency--

531
00:32:05,595 --> 00:32:07,430
Since when did you care about my career?

532
00:32:08,347 --> 00:32:09,307
Hey!

533
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:12,143
You're not some superstar at home.

534
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:13,811
Why would you bring that up now?

535
00:32:13,895 --> 00:32:16,355
Why did you take it?
You don't know what that implies.

536
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,940
Didn't you learn your lesson?

537
00:32:18,816 --> 00:32:20,318
You brat.

538
00:32:21,277 --> 00:32:22,570
I can't even punch you.

539
00:32:23,112 --> 00:32:24,113
You're so annoying!

540
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,628
<i>I knew it.</i>

541
00:32:40,213 --> 00:32:41,464
<i>You can't live without me.</i>

542
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:51,724
Hae-hyo! Won Hae-hyo!

543
00:32:56,437 --> 00:32:57,605
I met with your aunt.

544
00:32:57,688 --> 00:33:00,775
Her friends are totally in love
with you from <i>The First Human</i>.

545
00:33:00,858 --> 00:33:03,611
Your aunt and her friends
liked you more than Hye-jun.

546
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:07,698
-What's wrong?
-What?

547
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:09,617
You're not going to respond?

548
00:33:10,952 --> 00:33:12,662
Did you buy followers for my account?

549
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:19,710
I did.

550
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:22,463
You did?

551
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:24,006
How can you admit that so fast?

552
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,968
It's difficult to keep a lie going alone.

553
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:29,470
You're an adult. Let's share the burden.

554
00:33:30,346 --> 00:33:32,390
Why would I
when I had nothing to do with it?

555
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:36,811
Because you benefited from it.

556
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,105
I didn't gain anything.

557
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:44,777
Even if I didn't gain anything,
had you been more grateful for what I did,

558
00:33:44,861 --> 00:33:46,362
I would have shouldered it alone.

559
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:48,614
What did I gain from it?

560
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:51,367
"You're popular." "Young people like you."

561
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:53,953
It helps when casting a rookie like you.

562
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:55,371
You crushed my self-esteem

563
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:01,294
just for that?

564
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:06,257
I wanted to prove
that I could make it on my own.

565
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,551
That's the one thing I asked you
to let me have!

566
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:17,351
It's embarrassing. I'm embarrassed.

567
00:34:20,354 --> 00:34:22,023
How can I do anything now?

568
00:34:23,107 --> 00:34:24,650
How can I face people?

569
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:27,737
How can I live with dignity?

570
00:35:15,952 --> 00:35:17,536
What? What are you doing?

571
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,705
It's all because of you.

572
00:35:20,206 --> 00:35:21,958
It's all your fault!

573
00:35:26,295 --> 00:35:29,215
Gosh. Goodness. Why are you hitting me?

574
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:30,591
What did I tell you?

575
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:34,303
I told you I wanted to send Hae-hyo
to a private school.

576
00:35:34,387 --> 00:35:36,138
But you sent him to a public school,

577
00:35:36,222 --> 00:35:38,224
and his whole life is ruined now.

578
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:40,893
Even Hae-na's life is ruined!

579
00:35:53,197 --> 00:35:56,075
HAE-HYO

580
00:35:59,745 --> 00:36:00,788
Why is he calling?

581
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,835
Hello?

582
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:08,421
<i>I'm in front of your house.
I need to be comforted.</i>

583
00:36:18,472 --> 00:36:21,142
I'm just going to sit here.
Don't talk to me.

584
00:36:23,602 --> 00:36:25,563
Then why did you ask me to come out?

585
00:36:32,194 --> 00:36:33,195
I'll be quiet.

586
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:02,183
JEONG-HA

587
00:37:20,242 --> 00:37:21,285
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

588
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:30,795
Can't I go home? I'm sleepy.

589
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:32,838
Hey, it hasn't been that long.

590
00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:34,757
It's been over an hour.

591
00:37:37,551 --> 00:37:38,844
It's only been 30 minutes.

592
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:42,932
That means it was that much boring.

593
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:48,562
-Let's go.
-Good.

594
00:37:50,356 --> 00:37:52,942
-You seem glad.
-Because I am.

595
00:37:55,027 --> 00:37:56,153
I can breathe again.

596
00:37:57,071 --> 00:37:58,614
Was it that suffocating?

597
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:01,575
Yes. You won't even tell me
what's going on.

598
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:03,077
You told me to be quiet.

599
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:05,037
I'm not in the mood to talk.

600
00:38:06,247 --> 00:38:09,291
If you didn't want to talk,
why did you call me out here?

601
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,751
Wasn't I nice to you?

602
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:12,378
That's why I'm here.

603
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,757
All the nice things I did
only amount to 30 minutes?

604
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:18,759
Do you feel better?

605
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:21,637
I'm so angry at you,
so I forgot why I was upset.

606
00:38:22,638 --> 00:38:23,556
Was that comforting?

607
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:30,104
Aren't I getting better now?

608
00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:39,613
Hurry up.

609
00:38:45,077 --> 00:38:46,537
Why are you walking so fast?

610
00:38:56,755 --> 00:38:58,424
GRANDPA

611
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,096
Hey, Grandpa.

612
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,934
Since you moved down to the basement,
I barely get to see you.

613
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:10,352
I just wanted to hear your voice.

614
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:12,271
I'm glad you called.

615
00:39:12,354 --> 00:39:14,648
It's been a while since I talked to you.

616
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:15,816
Right.

617
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:20,654
I'm filming a commercial today.

618
00:39:21,697 --> 00:39:22,823
Congrats.

619
00:39:23,824 --> 00:39:26,535
Isn't it hard to shoot a commercial
without an agent?

620
00:39:27,286 --> 00:39:28,496
Should I talk to Min-jae?

621
00:39:29,914 --> 00:39:32,374
I have someone in mind.

622
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:37,046
Sir, I won't be working
with Yeong-nam from now on.

623
00:39:37,129 --> 00:39:39,173
I had to make this decision.

624
00:39:39,757 --> 00:39:42,176
I know that he will never give up working.

625
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:45,387
But he never listens to me.

626
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:49,058
Do you want to see him destroy
his shoulders while working with me?

627
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:19,338
Hey, what are you doing today?

628
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:20,589
I have work.

629
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:24,552
<i>Look at him. He wants to
keep his pride in front of me.</i>

630
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:27,137
Can you give me a ride?
I'm shooting a commercial today.

631
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:29,056
-No.
-I know you'll give me a ride.

632
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:30,432
Why can't you just say yes?

633
00:40:30,516 --> 00:40:32,351
I won't do that this time.

634
00:40:38,524 --> 00:40:40,651
He's here. The model is here.

635
00:40:40,734 --> 00:40:43,612
-Hello.
-Thank you for coming.

636
00:40:43,696 --> 00:40:47,366
My son drove me here.
It wasn't any trouble.

637
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:51,620
I see. That's great. I was worried
that you didn't have an agent.

638
00:40:52,371 --> 00:40:53,372
-Hello.
-Hi.

639
00:40:53,455 --> 00:40:56,333
We don't have much time.
Let me go over the storyboard quickly.

640
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:59,253
-Listen carefully.
-It's your job. Why would I listen to him?

641
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:01,213
You're younger and smarter.

642
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:04,258
-It's your job. You have to listen to him.
-You little…

643
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:07,261
Is that your thing? You guys are so funny.

644
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:10,556
-Look over here.
-Okay.

645
00:41:14,643 --> 00:41:16,353
We're going to the law firm after brunch.

646
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:18,480
Let's stop by A June Entertainment
on our way.

647
00:41:19,106 --> 00:41:20,274
Why?

648
00:41:20,357 --> 00:41:22,109
I have a meeting with Mr. Lee.

649
00:41:22,192 --> 00:41:25,154
-Why are you meeting him?
-He went to see my brother.

650
00:41:25,237 --> 00:41:27,031
-Your brother?
-Yes.

651
00:41:28,073 --> 00:41:30,367
Gosh. He's unbelievable.

652
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:36,582
So did he win over your brother?

653
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,254
Talking to his brother was
pretty effective. He called right away.

654
00:41:43,422 --> 00:41:45,841
I wonder if he's almost here.

655
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:52,306
My gosh. You and I seem to be
on the same wavelength.

656
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:53,474
Come on in.

657
00:41:55,476 --> 00:41:56,477
Here.

658
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,526
Hye-jun, you have quite the aura.

659
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,862
You really have made it, haven't you?

660
00:42:06,945 --> 00:42:08,906
Do you want a drink?
You didn't have to come here.

661
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:11,533
I could have gone to you. Take a seat.

662
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,078
Look at the flowers.

663
00:42:14,161 --> 00:42:16,622
I bought them at a shop
in Yangjae-dong this morning.

664
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:17,748
Aren't they beautiful?

665
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:22,461
Did you forget what you did to me?

666
00:42:22,544 --> 00:42:24,880
How can I forget that?

667
00:42:24,963 --> 00:42:26,465
I'll do better next time.

668
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,427
You're indeed a professional.

669
00:42:31,595 --> 00:42:32,513
I am.

670
00:42:34,056 --> 00:42:35,224
I'll give you that.

671
00:42:35,307 --> 00:42:36,433
Thank you.

672
00:42:36,517 --> 00:42:39,603
I want to work harder now that
you've acknowledged my effort.

673
00:42:39,687 --> 00:42:41,647
Please keep working harder,

674
00:42:42,356 --> 00:42:44,400
and don't ever come near me again.

675
00:42:45,818 --> 00:42:47,152
Stay away from my family.

676
00:42:47,736 --> 00:42:49,321
-Did he say something?
-Why give him a gift card?

677
00:42:49,405 --> 00:42:51,949
He didn't take it. Did he say he did? Why?

678
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:55,536
He said he got scammed before,
so he's very careful.

679
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:57,579
This is a gift card.

680
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,958
I couldn't help Hye-jun before,
so I'd like to give this to you instead.

681
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,794
You can give that to him, then.

682
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:09,883
You know, I got scammed once.

683
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:13,470
I would have accepted it if I wasn't
scammed. I'm careful nowadays.

684
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:16,140
<i>I don't like him.</i>

685
00:43:17,558 --> 00:43:19,685
<i>He was nothing like you.</i>

686
00:43:20,686 --> 00:43:21,895
I'm done talking to you.

687
00:43:22,688 --> 00:43:25,482
But I'm not done.
Call me whenever you need me.

688
00:43:25,566 --> 00:43:28,777
You know me. I'm the best
when it comes to cleaning up messes.

689
00:43:28,861 --> 00:43:31,530
You just don't know
how this industry works.

690
00:43:31,613 --> 00:43:34,450
Celebrities are prey for con artists.

691
00:43:34,533 --> 00:43:36,326
I'm immune to them

692
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,370
thanks to you.

693
00:43:39,288 --> 00:43:40,748
You don't have to sign with me.

694
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:43,333
I'm happy to see you from time to time.

695
00:43:44,543 --> 00:43:45,544
Enjoy your lunch.

696
00:43:46,211 --> 00:43:47,796
-Do you want to join me?
-No.

697
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,632
Fine. Yes. Play hard-to-get.
Don't make it easy for me.

698
00:43:50,716 --> 00:43:52,342
Hye-jun, hold on. Wait.

699
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,101
I was your first agent.

700
00:44:02,144 --> 00:44:03,479
You never forget your first.

701
00:44:05,939 --> 00:44:07,232
I don't think I ever will.

702
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:20,454
I almost had him.

703
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,086
GYEONG-JUN

704
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,426
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Why did you tell him you were scammed?

705
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,511
<i>What?</i>

706
00:44:39,348 --> 00:44:41,683
-I'm sorry.
-<i>What?</i>

707
00:44:41,767 --> 00:44:43,810
I heard you didn't take the gift card.

708
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:45,062
Why did you say you did?

709
00:44:45,145 --> 00:44:46,897
<i>Do you think I'd take that?</i>

710
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,649
<i>Who do you think I am?</i>

711
00:44:48,732 --> 00:44:50,192
<i>You need to repent more.</i>

712
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:04,915
-Here you go, ma'am.
-Okay.

713
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:08,627
I'm finalizing the credit appraisal
for Iyu Corporation,

714
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,838
but they don't have a good credit score.

715
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:13,840
-Their finances?
-Worse than last year's.

716
00:45:13,924 --> 00:45:15,384
We should adjust the loan.

717
00:45:16,677 --> 00:45:18,720
We have a long history with them.

718
00:45:18,804 --> 00:45:20,180
Let's think about it.

719
00:45:21,807 --> 00:45:23,976
-You can answer it.
-No, I don't have to.

720
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:26,478
Pick it up. It might be your brother.

721
00:45:29,773 --> 00:45:31,733
-An unknown number.
-I bet it's a sales rep.

722
00:45:31,817 --> 00:45:33,402
I'm a curious person.

723
00:45:33,485 --> 00:45:34,528
Hello?

724
00:45:37,364 --> 00:45:39,491
<i>This is Lieutenant Kim Ju-yeong,
a cybercrime investigator</i>

725
00:45:39,575 --> 00:45:40,993
<i>at Secho Police Station.</i>

726
00:45:41,076 --> 00:45:43,537
-<i>Is this Sa Gyeong-jun?</i>
-Yes, speaking.

727
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,207
You've been sued
for contempt and defamation.

728
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:51,336
<i>Didn't you reply to a comment
by an ID that starts with "top"</i>

729
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,841
in a news article about the Best Actor
from OVN Drama Awards?

730
00:45:55,924 --> 00:45:57,092
<i>Do you remember that?</i>

731
00:46:00,304 --> 00:46:01,638
Yes, I do.

732
00:46:04,683 --> 00:46:09,021
Do you know how much money
I spent on catching those haters online?

733
00:46:09,605 --> 00:46:12,441
This is the best law firm in Korea.

734
00:46:15,485 --> 00:46:16,570
No compliments?

735
00:46:18,196 --> 00:46:19,364
Good job.

736
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:25,537
Let's go.

737
00:46:33,295 --> 00:46:35,631
Have a seat.
Your lawyer will be here shortly.

738
00:46:36,381 --> 00:46:38,050
Okay. Thank you.

739
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,516
What a superb view.

740
00:46:51,396 --> 00:46:55,525
Hello, I'm Jung Ji-a,
and I'll be in charge of this case.

741
00:46:56,902 --> 00:46:59,696
Wait. When I came here the other day,
you weren't on the case.

742
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,074
I just started working here.
I'm only an associate.

743
00:47:02,157 --> 00:47:03,575
The team leader will be here.

744
00:47:04,868 --> 00:47:06,078
Congrats.

745
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,622
Shouldn't you be sorry?

746
00:47:08,705 --> 00:47:11,166
You knew that I was waiting
for the bar exam results.

747
00:47:11,249 --> 00:47:14,044
-How could you not call?
-I never thought you would fail.

748
00:47:14,127 --> 00:47:15,379
Who knows?

749
00:47:16,129 --> 00:47:17,881
How's the case going?

750
00:47:19,049 --> 00:47:21,843
I notified everyone,
so they'll be summoned soon.

751
00:47:22,427 --> 00:47:25,013
But some wanted to apologize
and ask for your forgiveness.

752
00:47:25,097 --> 00:47:27,557
-How should we handle it?
-Let's follow the trend.

753
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:29,851
That means no forgiveness
and no settlement.

754
00:47:33,355 --> 00:47:34,398
APOLOGY LETTER

755
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:37,192
Read them.
These apology letters are for you.

756
00:47:41,363 --> 00:47:43,115
Anything from the ID starting with "top"?

757
00:47:43,198 --> 00:47:44,366
Yes. He wants to settle.

758
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:45,951
That kid? Never.

759
00:47:46,034 --> 00:47:47,285
He's not a kid.

760
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:49,663
It's a man in his 40s.

761
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,392
Is your mother terribly sick?

762
00:47:59,475 --> 00:48:01,561
I'm not sure

763
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:04,147
since her broken heart is the cause of it.

764
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,066
Can you deliver this to her?

765
00:48:07,608 --> 00:48:09,318
It should be you.

766
00:48:10,194 --> 00:48:13,156
Her condition will worsen if she sees me.

767
00:48:24,917 --> 00:48:26,752
I heard you haven eaten yet.

768
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:28,212
Have some of this.

769
00:48:29,255 --> 00:48:30,798
Just leave it there.

770
00:48:31,632 --> 00:48:33,426
Hae-na made it. It's porridge.

771
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:37,221
She didn't know how to make it,
but she managed by following a recipe.

772
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:41,142
She doesn't even know
that I hate porridge.

773
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:44,812
Most children couldn't care less
about our preferences.

774
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:49,400
How can they do this to me
when I devoted my life to them?

775
00:48:49,484 --> 00:48:50,860
You should eat something.

776
00:48:53,738 --> 00:48:55,156
But I can't be bothered.

777
00:48:59,952 --> 00:49:03,247
It's been a while since I ate your food.

778
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:07,043
You never cooked for me
after agreeing only to clean the house.

779
00:49:07,752 --> 00:49:10,922
<i>And that's how it should be,
so why does she sound upset?</i>

780
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:16,010
It's also been a while
since I ate freshly cooked rice.

781
00:49:16,093 --> 00:49:18,179
An electric rice cooker does the same job.

782
00:49:18,262 --> 00:49:19,180
It's just the mood.

783
00:49:19,263 --> 00:49:21,682
The mood can change your appetite.

784
00:49:21,766 --> 00:49:23,518
The mood is that important.

785
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:26,729
Where are you off to?

786
00:49:26,812 --> 00:49:27,980
Back to work.

787
00:49:28,064 --> 00:49:30,274
Take a break and sit down with me.

788
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:33,277
I have to head home early
to maintain our house too.

789
00:49:38,115 --> 00:49:40,910
It's not like I can make her stay
by paying her more.

790
00:49:50,169 --> 00:49:53,673
<i>Please come by the office.
I'll be waiting with the lawyer.</i>

791
00:50:00,346 --> 00:50:01,639
Hello.

792
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:03,349
You're here.

793
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,018
I bet you were shocked.

794
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:08,938
People can be so selfish, right?

795
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:11,566
After writing all those hate comments
about Hye-jun,

796
00:50:11,649 --> 00:50:14,110
he sued you
for writing hate comments back.

797
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:16,821
-Hello, there.
-Right.

798
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:20,658
Hold on. You look familiar.

799
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:22,743
I'm the ex-girlfriend.

800
00:50:22,827 --> 00:50:24,245
Oh, right.

801
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:26,163
Why are you here though?

802
00:50:26,247 --> 00:50:28,499
We'll try and settle.

803
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:31,168
-Hand me a written apology--
-I'm not writing one.

804
00:50:31,752 --> 00:50:34,005
-Why not?
-Because I did nothing wrong.

805
00:50:34,088 --> 00:50:35,965
You should, even though you didn't.

806
00:50:36,048 --> 00:50:40,052
This person wrote one to Hye-jun
and is waiting for leniency.

807
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:43,514
Whoever this is, he isn't sorry at all.

808
00:50:43,598 --> 00:50:45,975
He's only faking it to get out of trouble.

809
00:50:46,058 --> 00:50:47,226
And so should you.

810
00:50:49,812 --> 00:50:52,523
What about my comment is insulting?

811
00:50:52,607 --> 00:50:56,485
"You're the one who dated Charlie Jung.

812
00:50:56,569 --> 00:50:58,487
He was your sugar daddy.

813
00:50:58,571 --> 00:51:01,282
I bet you were dumped by Charlie Jung
because you stink."

814
00:51:01,365 --> 00:51:04,076
Absolutely filthy.
How's that not a hate comment?

815
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,245
It's called "mirroring."

816
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:09,582
I only copied the words and phrases
that he used on Hye-jun.

817
00:51:09,665 --> 00:51:12,168
When did you agree
to be questioned by the police?

818
00:51:12,877 --> 00:51:14,378
I'll take care of it.

819
00:51:14,462 --> 00:51:16,297
Why did I ever contact you?

820
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:20,343
I thought you'd have a better plan.

821
00:51:21,552 --> 00:51:24,597
Did you think that Lee Tae-su would?

822
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,350
Why are you bringing him up?

823
00:51:27,433 --> 00:51:29,310
I don't know. Why do you think that is?

824
00:51:31,729 --> 00:51:35,066
It's because you won't listen to us.

825
00:51:35,149 --> 00:51:37,276
You'll only tell me to write an apology.

826
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,611
That much I know.

827
00:51:41,614 --> 00:51:42,990
Don't tell Hye-jun about this.

828
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:57,546
Haven't you memorized them yet?

829
00:51:59,924 --> 00:52:02,093
-No, I'm done.
-You weren't at Pilates today.

830
00:52:02,677 --> 00:52:04,929
I went to the gym hoping to run into you.

831
00:52:07,348 --> 00:52:08,224
Did you meet Do-ha?

832
00:52:08,891 --> 00:52:12,019
-He doesn't work out at that hour.
-He's a bastard.

833
00:52:13,604 --> 00:52:15,356
It's not like you to swear.

834
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:17,066
Are you feeling okay?

835
00:52:19,068 --> 00:52:21,654
Actually, I'd give anything
to not feel okay.

836
00:52:23,197 --> 00:52:24,949
-What's up?
-I don't want to say.

837
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:32,915
JEONG-HA

838
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,876
<i>I finally got to your text.</i>

839
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,921
<i>Sorry. I didn't know
you texted me yesterday.</i>

840
00:52:39,004 --> 00:52:40,589
That was quick.

841
00:52:43,134 --> 00:52:44,135
It's from Jeong-ha.

842
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,179
I texted her last night,
but she read and ignored it.

843
00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:50,391
-She must have got to it late.
-I guess.

844
00:52:50,474 --> 00:52:53,728
She has an interview with Hae-ji
for a makeup job today.

845
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,691
-How do you know that?
-Because I set it up.

846
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:05,448
Okay, we'll start filming!

847
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,491
Let's go.

848
00:53:13,873 --> 00:53:16,333
-Over here.
-Here, I found it.

849
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:19,044
-Really?
-Stop by the dry cleaner's for me.

850
00:53:19,128 --> 00:53:20,129
Got it.

851
00:53:22,757 --> 00:53:25,176
<i>HABITS THAT MAKE YOU RICH</i>
ACTOR LEE HAE-JI

852
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:34,727
Hello, I'm An Jeong-ha.

853
00:53:37,021 --> 00:53:39,106
Oh, right. Please have a seat.

854
00:53:42,568 --> 00:53:44,445
You look just like you do in your photos.

855
00:53:45,404 --> 00:53:46,822
You've seen my photos?

856
00:53:46,906 --> 00:53:49,700
Yes, I looked up
your photos and videos on social media.

857
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:53,120
I've also made sure
to make preparations for you.

858
00:53:55,289 --> 00:53:56,165
The job's yours.

859
00:53:57,708 --> 00:54:00,085
Sorry? But I didn't show you anything yet.

860
00:54:00,169 --> 00:54:02,922
I haven't, but the job's still yours.

861
00:54:03,005 --> 00:54:06,008
I only asked to see you
to tell you this in person.

862
00:54:06,759 --> 00:54:09,470
-Why?
-Hae-hyo introduced you to me.

863
00:54:09,553 --> 00:54:12,306
I trust his judgment of people.

864
00:54:13,224 --> 00:54:16,519
That's not something I want though.
I want you to hire me for my talents.

865
00:54:16,602 --> 00:54:19,980
Jeong-ha, I'm not a fool,
just so you know.

866
00:54:21,065 --> 00:54:24,568
Let's see.
Remember the video about the pills?

867
00:54:25,152 --> 00:54:29,323
<i>There's a bottle of pills
I always carry with me.</i>

868
00:54:29,406 --> 00:54:32,535
<i>I've studied the composition of cosmetics,</i>

869
00:54:33,202 --> 00:54:37,748
and there may be an ingredient that could
hurt my clients unbeknownst to them.

870
00:54:38,332 --> 00:54:42,586
This is why I always
carry around this antihistamine.

871
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,672
What won me over was your talent.

872
00:54:46,382 --> 00:54:47,675
Thanks for that.

873
00:54:47,758 --> 00:54:50,010
I'll continue to work
with my regular staff

874
00:54:50,094 --> 00:54:53,681
and I'll visit your studio
when I need a simple touch of makeup.

875
00:54:53,764 --> 00:54:56,475
Thank you. Could you perhaps go over this?

876
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:57,601
Sure.

877
00:55:08,779 --> 00:55:09,989
Yes!

878
00:55:10,072 --> 00:55:14,743
<i>HABITS THAT MAKE YOU RICH</i>
ACTOR LEE HAE-JI

879
00:55:17,955 --> 00:55:19,039
What do you have next?

880
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:22,751
I don't know. I bet you're busy though.

881
00:55:22,835 --> 00:55:25,671
I'm shooting a commercial
probably until after midnight.

882
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:28,340
Oh, it's Jeong-ha.

883
00:55:30,384 --> 00:55:31,886
Hey.

884
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:33,345
Thank you so much.

885
00:55:34,096 --> 00:55:37,099
-What's going on?
-Lee Hae-ji gave me the job.

886
00:55:37,182 --> 00:55:39,685
You're my savior, you know that?

887
00:55:39,768 --> 00:55:41,020
Hye-jun's next to me…

888
00:55:42,354 --> 00:55:44,607
and is shooting lasers from his eyes.

889
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:46,567
Tell him I'll call him.

890
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:47,776
Sure.

891
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:52,072
She said she'll call you.

892
00:56:04,668 --> 00:56:06,045
Hye-jun, what are you up to?

893
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:08,797
She said she'd call, but hasn't.

894
00:56:14,595 --> 00:56:16,180
HYE-JUN

895
00:56:22,102 --> 00:56:24,355
-Hey.
-You said you'd call.

896
00:56:25,606 --> 00:56:28,192
Sorry about that. I'm on the bus,

897
00:56:28,275 --> 00:56:29,693
so I'll call you later.

898
00:56:33,364 --> 00:56:36,533
She said it as if
I've never been on a bus before.

899
00:56:43,582 --> 00:56:44,750
HYE-JUN

900
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,628
<i>So where are you headed?</i>

901
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:50,839
<i>Home.</i>

902
00:56:59,223 --> 00:57:00,307
I'll get going then.

903
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:02,810
Why haven't you quit?

904
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:06,230
It's not like you need the money anymore.

905
00:57:08,232 --> 00:57:12,236
Money isn't the only reason
I've kept working all my life.

906
00:57:13,862 --> 00:57:17,116
What else can it be?
Why work when your family has money now?

907
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:19,785
What did Hye-jun say?
Is he okay with this?

908
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:23,789
According to him,
my life is mine, and his life is his.

909
00:57:23,872 --> 00:57:25,708
He said so in middle school.

910
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:27,626
And you still believe that?

911
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,253
He was only a child back then.

912
00:57:29,336 --> 00:57:31,380
It was his defense mechanism talking.

913
00:57:31,463 --> 00:57:34,508
He probably only said so
because he made peace with it.

914
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:36,719
And I don't feel bad about this job.

915
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:41,348
If you told me you liked it,
I would've called you pretentious.

916
00:57:41,932 --> 00:57:43,976
Everyone's different, you know.

917
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:47,313
Something that you can never do
may seem okay in my eyes.

918
00:57:48,772 --> 00:57:51,900
Are you asking me this
because you don't like me coming over?

919
00:57:51,984 --> 00:57:53,027
Of course not.

920
00:57:56,196 --> 00:57:59,950
I just thought how I'd feel
if I were in your shoe.

921
00:58:01,452 --> 00:58:02,786
Can I go now then?

922
00:58:04,788 --> 00:58:05,998
Sure thing.

923
00:58:20,554 --> 00:58:21,555
Here.

924
00:58:22,097 --> 00:58:23,223
What is this?

925
00:58:23,807 --> 00:58:25,059
My pay for today's shoot.

926
00:58:25,142 --> 00:58:27,478
In cash?
I thought they wired you the money.

927
00:58:27,561 --> 00:58:30,814
Some companies pay you in cash
on the very day. Take it.

928
00:58:53,087 --> 00:58:54,338
Gosh, how much is this?

929
00:58:54,421 --> 00:58:58,425
One, two, three, four, five, six…

930
00:59:14,149 --> 00:59:16,860
It's too much. I'll only take 200,000 won.

931
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:18,195
Just take it all.

932
00:59:19,446 --> 00:59:21,323
Hye-jun must give you a hefty allowance.

933
00:59:23,784 --> 00:59:26,578
Still, spend it yourself
since you earned it.

934
00:59:27,913 --> 00:59:29,123
Yeong-nam,

935
00:59:30,582 --> 00:59:32,835
do you know why I wanted to earn money?

936
00:59:33,794 --> 00:59:34,920
Why is that?

937
00:59:35,504 --> 00:59:36,588
To give to you.

938
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,303
When you were growing up,

939
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:46,932
I barely provided for you.

940
00:59:48,725 --> 00:59:50,477
What I regret the most

941
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:53,355
is that I couldn't
put you through college.

942
00:59:54,481 --> 00:59:57,192
You were way smarter than Yeong-gyun,

943
00:59:58,569 --> 01:00:00,696
but you burned yourself out

944
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:04,741
by tutoring him instead

945
01:00:05,325 --> 01:00:06,910
and taking care of the family.

946
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:10,664
Thankfully, you met your wife

947
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:14,877
and was able to have kids
and start a family.

948
01:00:17,296 --> 01:00:18,881
You're proof

949
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:22,050
that luck finds those that are selfless.

950
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:29,892
I couldn't be happier
to give you what I earn.

951
01:00:29,975 --> 01:00:31,977
I want to earn as much as I can,

952
01:00:33,145 --> 01:00:35,564
so I can make it up to you
for being a lousy father.

953
01:00:36,273 --> 01:00:38,358
Why are you doing this?

954
01:00:38,442 --> 01:00:39,568
What?

955
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:44,323
I don't have many years left to live.

956
01:00:44,865 --> 01:00:46,283
Don't be ridiculous.

957
01:00:46,366 --> 01:00:48,952
You will probably outlive me,
so don't worry.

958
01:00:51,788 --> 01:00:53,540
Why are you in tears?

959
01:00:53,624 --> 01:00:54,875
I'm not.

960
01:01:01,256 --> 01:01:05,719
Why don't you come to work with me?

961
01:01:06,595 --> 01:01:10,098
It's time you quit the job
you're doing with Jang-man.

962
01:01:10,682 --> 01:01:12,518
I'll be good to you.

963
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:15,729
You can keep every penny I earn.
I don't need any of it.

964
01:01:15,812 --> 01:01:17,648
Why are you being this way?

965
01:01:17,731 --> 01:01:20,734
Why are you maturing all of a sudden?

966
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,737
It's scary when people change
all of a sudden.

967
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:24,988
Go back to your old self.

968
01:01:25,072 --> 01:01:28,033
But I don't want to live
the way I've been living.

969
01:01:29,493 --> 01:01:31,495
Even if finally growing up kills me,

970
01:01:34,122 --> 01:01:35,624
that's what I will do.

971
01:01:35,707 --> 01:01:37,000
Just don't!

972
01:01:58,021 --> 01:01:59,022
Surprise.

973
01:02:02,234 --> 01:02:03,360
<i>What do we do?</i>

974
01:02:03,443 --> 01:02:05,445
<i>She's going to expose your relationship.</i>

975
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:06,822
<i>This is bad for Hye-jun.</i>

976
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:13,453
Aren't you happy?

977
01:02:15,956 --> 01:02:16,873
I am.

978
01:02:18,292 --> 01:02:19,418
I'm too tired to get up.

979
01:02:27,801 --> 01:02:29,052
I thought you had a shoot.

980
01:02:29,136 --> 01:02:32,139
I chose you and dinner instead.

981
01:02:36,768 --> 01:02:39,313
-What?
-You should get yourself some dinner.

982
01:02:39,896 --> 01:02:42,774
And don't come by any more.
There may be paparazzi tailing you.

983
01:02:43,692 --> 01:02:47,279
-What if people find out we're dating?
-Then we'll date out in the open.

984
01:02:51,908 --> 01:02:53,410
First was your ex-girlfriend

985
01:02:54,077 --> 01:02:55,829
and then top celebrity Jin Seo-u.

986
01:02:56,788 --> 01:02:58,749
Does that make me your third woman?

987
01:02:58,832 --> 01:03:01,501
You're not like the other two.

988
01:03:02,961 --> 01:03:06,590
We'll be able to date in public
once we announce our relationship.

989
01:03:09,551 --> 01:03:12,596
Cameras will follow us around,
and we'll be broadcast live.

990
01:03:13,722 --> 01:03:15,307
What will I do if we break up?

991
01:03:22,147 --> 01:03:23,190
Are we breaking up?

992
01:03:25,817 --> 01:03:27,277
You never know what'll happen.

993
01:03:31,615 --> 01:03:34,993
Why did you call Hae-hyo first and not me
when something good happened?

994
01:03:38,455 --> 01:03:39,706
Because you're busy.

995
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:41,166
But despite that,

996
01:03:41,249 --> 01:03:43,502
I never once ignored your text

997
01:03:43,585 --> 01:03:45,712
and even made time to come to see you.

998
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:53,470
Even with that hectic schedule of yours,

999
01:03:54,137 --> 01:03:56,390
you've been doing your best.

1000
01:03:56,973 --> 01:03:58,392
But you see,

1001
01:03:59,434 --> 01:04:00,977
I'm trying my best too.

1002
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:05,649
It will be brief,
so I should make you comfortable.

1003
01:04:05,732 --> 01:04:08,193
It will be brief,
so I should make you happy.

1004
01:04:08,276 --> 01:04:10,404
It will be brief, so I should be happy.

1005
01:04:22,874 --> 01:04:24,167
I'm sorry.

1006
01:04:27,421 --> 01:04:28,714
Are you happy right now?

1007
01:04:31,174 --> 01:04:33,051
You have everything you wanted

1008
01:04:34,678 --> 01:04:37,597
and your career took off
in a far better way than you predicted.

1009
01:04:47,065 --> 01:04:48,692
But you also seem like our dads.

1010
01:04:49,776 --> 01:04:51,820
The dads that never had a life

1011
01:04:51,903 --> 01:04:54,197
because they had a family to provide for.

1012
01:04:56,783 --> 01:04:58,910
CHI-YEONG

1013
01:05:07,002 --> 01:05:08,545
Your job's calling you.

1014
01:05:27,355 --> 01:05:28,607
I bet you're exhausted.

1015
01:05:31,651 --> 01:05:32,778
No, I'm good.

1016
01:05:32,861 --> 01:05:35,363
You only have one more sequence left,
so hang in there.

1017
01:05:39,326 --> 01:05:41,328
-Would you like your phone?
-Sure.

1018
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:43,413
LEE TAE-SU

1019
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:52,464
Hello?

1020
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:57,010
Hye-jun, I think it's finally time
for me to properly help you.

1021
01:05:57,093 --> 01:05:58,345
What are you talking about?

1022
01:05:59,054 --> 01:06:01,973
Do you have any idea
what tomorrow's headline will be?

1023
01:06:13,777 --> 01:06:19,199
WAS SA HYE-JUN THE LAST PERSON

1024
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:34,965

I'll sue them both,
the paper and the reporter.

1030
01:07:34,983 --> 01:07:36,526
What are they saying?

1031
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:38,486
I did nothing wrong.

1032
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:41,698
We may have to settle with him
because of you, although we shouldn't.

1033

<i>Let's reveal the text message.</i>

1034
01:07:43,658 --> 01:07:45,785
Why should we,
when there's an easy way out?

1035
01:07:45,869 --> 01:07:47,579
Because he's a person.

1036
01:07:47,662 --> 01:07:50,415
<i>He'd better brace himself
