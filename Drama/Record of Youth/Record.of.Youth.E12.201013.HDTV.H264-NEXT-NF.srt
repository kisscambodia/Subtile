RECORD OF YOUTH

00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,358
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS AN
"EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT" AND IS SUPPORTED

3
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:09,045
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, TOURISM
AND THE KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

4
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:13,232
JI-A

5
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:23,867
Hey.

6
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:26,787
<i>I met with a reporter today.
You'll see an article about it.</i>

7
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:30,082
What do you mean?

8
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:31,834
Ji-a came to see me.

9
00:00:41,552 --> 00:00:42,928
I'm not following.

10
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:44,847
This moody, selfish girl

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,224
chose to make a little sacrifice for you.

12
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:49,309
Hae-hyo is here. Let me talk to him first.

13
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:53,605
Ji-a is one thing,

14
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,817
but shouldn't you have told me
before she met the reporter?

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,736
-That's why I'm here.
-You came too late.

16
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:02,156
Are you mad at me?

17
00:01:04,783 --> 00:01:06,702
I wanted to help you.

18
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:09,538
I cooperated because I thought
it'd be helpful for you.

19
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:13,417
-Is that so wrong?
-With some help, you must refuse it.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,461
That's the case with Ji-a's help.

21
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:17,254
You've changed.

22
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:20,841
-How?
-The Sa Hye-jun I used to know

23
00:01:20,924 --> 00:01:23,886
would have been grateful to the people
who are trying to help him.

24
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:26,805
Don't you see that I'm upset
because I'm grateful?

25
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:30,392
I don't want to have to make lame excuses.

26
00:01:32,853 --> 00:01:35,939
The truth will come out with time,
so I just need to hold this out.

27
00:01:36,023 --> 00:01:39,109
I'm offering to make those lame excuses
on your behalf.

28
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,945
You'd step in and help
if I were in this situation.

29
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:43,322
The old you would have.

30
00:01:43,405 --> 00:01:45,741
Why do you keep saying that I've changed?

31
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:48,035
Look at yourself.
You never used to be like this.

32
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:50,621
You always respected my opinion
and consulted me first.

33
00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:53,082
You no longer have time for that.

34
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:54,625
You're always busy.

35
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,127
You're with Jeong-ha when you're free.
You don't have time for us.

36
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,422
And Jin-u is dating Hae-na.

37
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:02,049
What is this mess?

38
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,307
Jin-u and Hae-na…

39
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,559
When did you find out?

40
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:16,688
So,

41
00:02:18,232 --> 00:02:19,566
you knew?

42
00:02:26,156 --> 00:02:27,908
Those jerks…

43
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:29,409
You guys hid it from me?

44
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,080
You guys fooled me?

45
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:35,791
No. Just until Jin-u could tell you
himself…

46
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:46,885
What's with him?

47
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:48,929
I'm the one who should be angry now.

48
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:52,850
I guess guys fight just like girls do.

49
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:55,727
Don't guys tussle?

50
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:57,563
You two are such gentlemen.

51
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:00,774
In movies, I always see guys
punching each other.

52
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,491
Anyway, you should thank Ji-a

53
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:10,701
when you see her later.

54
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:14,121
I'm so grateful that she stepped in.

55
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,542
What did Hae-hyo and Ji-a talk about?

56
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:26,403
RECORD OF YOUTH

57
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:28,051
This isn't like you.

58
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:29,970
Your parents won't be happy about this.

59
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:32,097
Do you still like Hye-jun's girlfriend?

60
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:39,479
Learn to hide your emotions,

61
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:41,481
or Hye-jun will figure it out soon.

62
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:43,859
If he finds out, he'll be so hurt.

63
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:47,070
You know exactly where to poke.

64
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:48,864
You'll be a great lawyer.

65
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:52,492
I want to protect Hye-jun.

66
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:54,077
When we were together,

67
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:57,206
I did all sorts of things
to test him as well as my love.

68
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:58,373
He's the real deal.

69
00:03:58,874 --> 00:04:00,292
That's my conclusion.

70
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:04,588
And now that he's taken,

71
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:06,089
I want him even more.

72
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:09,051
I'm glad to hear there's something
you can't have your way with.

73
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:10,093
I'm thrilled.

74
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:11,887
If I can't have him,

75
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,640
it means you have no hope whatsoever.

76
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:17,601
I'm sure you want things to work out
between me and Hye-jun.

77
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:18,602
Isn't that right?

78
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:21,605
I guess you are.

79
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:25,859
But Jeong-ha won't date just about anyone

80
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:27,694
even if she and Hye-jun break up.

81
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:30,405
And I do?

82
00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:32,824
You're so good at insulting others.

83
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:35,827
Just call the reporter at <i>Out News</i>
and schedule a meeting for me.

84
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:46,713
Hey, we need another switch
and electrical outlet over here.

85
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:49,383
You already told us.
Just go back upstairs.

86
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:52,761
-Hey, are you here to monitor us?
-Fine. I'm going back upstairs.

87
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:54,930
Mr. Sa.

88
00:04:55,722 --> 00:04:58,850
-You don't need to give us dinner.
-Were you going to stay for dinner?

89
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:00,894
-Go up and get some rest.
-Okay.

90
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:31,216
Looking good.

91
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:32,175
Come in.

92
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:35,345
-Hi.
-Yes.

93
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:36,763
Are you done?

94
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:40,559
I knew it. He didn't come back upstairs.

95
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:41,643
What do you mean?

96
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:44,021
I told him to rest up,
but he must've stepped out.

97
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:46,565
Why does he need to rest?
Is he not feeling well?

98
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:49,359
He won't let me tell you guys.

99
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,028
He saw a doctor for his shoulder,

100
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:54,031
and he was told he'll need
another surgery if he's not careful.

101
00:05:54,114 --> 00:05:55,574
Can you talk to him?

102
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:58,160
He already had surgery,

103
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:00,162
but it didn't fully heal.

104
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:02,414
Can he keep working?

105
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:05,500
Of course not! But he's being stubborn.

106
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:08,920
He's too stubborn for his own good.

107
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:12,049
He takes after his mother,
so he's bullheaded.

108
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:14,885
I think he's embarrassed to face Hye-jun.

109
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:17,888
He was against Hye-jun's career choice.

110
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:21,850
Goodness.

111
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,776
Where have you been?

112
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:32,861
I was running errands.
Where are you going?

113
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:36,698
I think I got a job.
I have a meeting at the academy.

114
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:39,534
-Get going, then.
-What are you up to?

115
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:42,037
What do you think?
I have to fix up Hye-jun's room.

116
00:06:44,164 --> 00:06:45,999
Can't you give me a ride?

117
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,544
I have to walk all the way down there
to take the bus.

118
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:51,713
I'm old, so I tire very easily.

119
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:53,673
You look a lot more energetic than I do.

120
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:56,093
So? Aren't you going to give me a ride?

121
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:58,387
I won't. Why should I?

122
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:04,309
I'd have nothing more to wish for
if you could just talk more nicely.

123
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:07,896
Then I'd be too perfect.

124
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:15,779
You're baffled
that you just said that, right?

125
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:18,824
It's because I started watching
a lot more TV thanks to Hye-jun.

126
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:21,868
Women love it
when men say stuff like this on TV.

127
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:25,080
That's because they're good looking.
It won't work if you do it.

128
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:27,124
Whose fault is it that I look like this?

129
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:30,085
You gave me nothing good.

130
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:32,379
-Can I put on some music?
-No, you can't.

131
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:46,643
Just go alone.
Why do you want me to come with you?

132
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:48,186
Because it'll bother me.

133
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,939
You'd be so bored
if you had to wait alone outside.

134
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:56,570
-Is this it?
-Yes.

135
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:57,821
Come on.

136
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:00,782
Hello.

137
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:02,409
You're here.

138
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:06,037
Did you hire a manager?

139
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:08,206
No, this is my son.

140
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,709
Oh, I see.

141
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,711
He doesn't resemble you at all.

142
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:13,879
Take a seat.

143
00:08:13,962 --> 00:08:15,005
Let's sit down.

144
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:23,013
To be honest, it's still too early
for you to hire a manager.

145
00:08:23,096 --> 00:08:25,515
Unless we work even harder

146
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,893
and bring you more work.

147
00:08:28,602 --> 00:08:30,061
Why did you want to meet?

148
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:33,064
You got an offer for a TV commercial.
For a health supplement.

149
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:34,524
Really?

150
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,651
The pay must be pretty good.

151
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:38,361
Yes, it's for a TV commercial.

152
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:40,322
It's different from printed ads.

153
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:44,618
-Would you like something to drink?
-Sure, what do you have?

154
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,748
Well, sir.

155
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:53,084
Do you mind going down to the first floor
and picking up some beverages?

156
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:56,421
Why make my son do it?

157
00:08:56,505 --> 00:08:57,923
I don't need to drink anything.

158
00:08:58,006 --> 00:09:00,133
It's nothing difficult.

159
00:09:00,217 --> 00:09:03,053
-What should I get?
-Hey, don't bother.

160
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:06,806
My gosh.
You must love your son very dearly.

161
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,183
I'll get the staff to do it.

162
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:11,353
Why make such a fuss?
I can just go pick it up.

163
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:13,063
Are you complaining that I'm caring?

164
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:16,233
I'm not complaining.
You're the one making a fuss.

165
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:18,068
You need to work on this.

166
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:21,363
Must you talk to me like this
in front of my instructor?

167
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:23,240
What is she going to think of me now?

168
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:24,741
And what about our family?

169
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:26,785
She will think we're a hot mess.

170
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:29,996
No, I won't. I'll go.

171
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:35,126
Hold on, ma'am.

172
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:40,340
Why did I ask you to tag along?
How embarrassing!

173
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:41,466
Should I leave, then?

174
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:44,010
No, stay until I'm done.

175
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:47,389
Goodness.

176
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:48,848
I'm so embarrassed.

177
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:58,149
THE FAIRNESS OF SA HYE-JUN'S
BEST ACTOR AWARD QUESTIONED

178
00:10:01,403 --> 00:10:03,613
ISN'T SA HYE-JUN STILL A ROOKIE?

179
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:05,782
I DON'T GET HOW SOMEONE LIKE HIM
WON THE AWARD

180
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,037
Ae-suk!

181
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,503
-What's wrong?
-I get so angry every time I read these.

182
00:10:18,587 --> 00:10:21,256
People at the broadcasting station
aren't idiots.

183
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,550
They gave him the award
because he deserved it.

184
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:26,469
Of course!
Hye-jun was the only qualified nominee.

185
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:28,221
People are still talking about that?

186
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:30,056
I was reading the malicious comments.

187
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,641
What? Those punks.

188
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:35,770
I must tell the members.

189
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:39,983
The Giving Tree, Hye-jun All the Way,
and Sa Hye-jun Gallery.

190
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:42,819
I'll get the fans together
to raise the funds to sue them.

191
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:44,863
Is it really necessary to sue them?

192
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:48,074
Yes. People support that these days.

193
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:49,617
That's the trend.

194
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:51,703
Then how come Ms. Lee isn't suing them?

195
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:54,247
Exactly. We're going to do it
because we're frustrated.

196
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:56,166
How long is Hye-jun's contract?

197
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:58,168
-I don't know.
-Find out.

198
00:10:58,251 --> 00:10:59,753
He needs a bigger, better agency.

199
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:01,713
This agency is no good.

200
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:03,757
JJamppong? Is it a Chinese restaurant?

201
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:07,135
What's that?

202
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:11,139
Oh, I have to drop off
the side dishes at Hae-hyo's place,

203
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:13,058
so I made some for your family as well.

204
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:17,604
Great. I was wondering
what I should make for them

205
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:19,272
when Hye-jun's room is all done.

206
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:20,607
Is Yeong-nam working too?

207
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,776
-Yes, I think so.
-Ae-suk, Yeong-nam is…

208
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:26,363
It's nothing.

209
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:27,822
What is it?

210
00:11:27,906 --> 00:11:30,200
Let's talk later.
I have to go to Hae-hyo's place.

211
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:32,619
Every time I come here,
I don't want to leave.

212
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:34,913
Thanks.

213
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:36,081
I'm off.

214
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:47,175
-<i>The number you have dialed</i>
-Won Hae-na.

215
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:48,551
<i>is not available.</i>

216
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:51,179
-So, is this your plan?
-<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

217
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:54,140
How much longer

218
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:56,351
do you think you can avoid seeing
your mother?

219
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,272
MY DAUGHTER

220
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:19,165
Did you ignore my calls
when you were home?

221
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:23,753
-I'm sorry.
-Heading out to see Jin-u?

222
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:26,131
-Yes.
-Before you head out,

223
00:12:26,214 --> 00:12:28,925
can you spare me
about ten minutes of your time?

224
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:30,885
If you can't, we'll talk later.

225
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,805
I can.

226
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:38,184
I've done some thinking.

227
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:41,646
-Are you going to get angry?
-No.

228
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:44,149
I'm not that close-minded.

229
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:47,694
You have to be faithful to one man
once you get married,

230
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:50,405
so I support you dating
as much as you can before that.

231
00:12:50,488 --> 00:12:51,990
-Really?
-Of course,

232
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:55,618
I'd want to see you dating someone
who I approve of,

233
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:59,747
but it's okay. I understand
why you're charmed by Jin-u.

234
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:02,333
Thanks, Mom.

235
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:05,462
Just don't get pregnant.

236
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:07,505
And you can't marry him.

237
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,259
Have some fun and come home.

238
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:13,386
You don't approve at all.

239
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,556
Everything you have belongs to me.

240
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,641
I can claim ownership over you.

241
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:22,896
Your body is the only thing
you have sole control over.

242
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:24,731
I never asked you for anything,

243
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:26,858
so why claim ownership?

244
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:28,359
I obeyed my parents.

245
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:30,570
I have to live like that
just because you did?

246
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:32,071
Yes.

247
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:33,281
Go meet up with Jin-u.

248
00:13:33,364 --> 00:13:34,866
Have fun with him.

249
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:37,827
And learn how painful it is
to have a relationship

250
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:40,246
that has no future.

251
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,998
It'll help you grow.

252
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:45,126
Mom, you're much scarier than I thought.

253
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,964
I kept giving you guidelines,
and you stayed within them.

254
00:13:50,048 --> 00:13:52,091
That's why we got along so far.

255
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:53,676
You ruined our relationship.

256
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,806
If it's ruined already
and we can't put it back together,

257
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:59,599
we should reset it.

258
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:01,392
-No.
-I don't want to either.

259
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:06,898
Then I'll have to impose you
with some restrictions.

260
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:10,568
What kind of restrictions are put in place
when international conflicts occur?

261
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:13,446
Do you want the credit card or the car?

262
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,365
You're so smart.

263
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:17,700
Which one will affect you more?

264
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:19,118
Both, equally.

265
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:20,745
Don't try to fool me.

266
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:23,957
I think the credit card
will affect you a lot more.

267
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,668
I'll go easy on you for now.
I'm taking your car away.

268
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:30,129
Give me your car keys.

269
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,933
All cleared.

270
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,395
Okay, go have fun with your boyfriend.

271
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:47,188
I'm happy you're dating.

272
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:49,607
And welcome to the real world.

273
00:14:50,316 --> 00:14:52,527
I didn't think you'd be recording this.

274
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,071
If you want to help,
make it worth your while.

275
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:57,240
Sure, I want to.

276
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:59,868
You already know
which law firm you'll be joining, right?

277
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:01,452
How did you know?

278
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:03,746
My cousin works
at one of the big law firms.

279
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,249
The elders in our family
always compared us.

280
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,878
Did you date Hye-jun for a long time?

281
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:12,046
<i>Why is she being so rude?</i>

282
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:14,966
We were together
all through our early to mid-20s.

283
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,218
I know everything about him
during those years.

284
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:18,678
Okay, we're ready.

285
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:22,181
Your love is over,
but you're staying loyal to him.

286
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:24,851
But is it actually over?

287
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:27,645
<i>It's none of your business.
I can't stand her.</i>

288
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:29,772
Should I look at the camera?

289
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:31,149
Jin-u!

290
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,067
Hae-na!

291
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:36,404
Didn't your mom find out?

292
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,576
My mom said we can date.

293
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:44,120
Your mom is amazing.
I was worried for nothing.

294
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:49,000
We had such a narrow outlook.

295
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,294
My mom is so creative.

296
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:54,797
For the first time ever,
I realized I would never beat her.

297
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:57,592
Why beat your mom?
That was never my intention.

298
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:00,595
Otherwise, I would have never
kept our relationship a secret.

299
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:03,848
You're a bigger coward than I am.

300
00:16:05,016 --> 00:16:06,809
Yes, I am a coward.

301
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:10,146
Marriage is reality
whereas dating is like a fantasy.

302
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:12,690
Going from fantasy to reality…

303
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:14,233
I don't want to do that.

304
00:16:16,444 --> 00:16:17,946
I see.

305
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:21,032
I can trust you more now.

306
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:23,743
Because I now know
you're not recklessly emotional.

307
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,912
It's because I love you.

308
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,044
What? Did that make your heart skip?

309
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:36,214
-No!
-It clearly did.

310
00:16:37,757 --> 00:16:41,636
What? I'm sure he has a lot
to deal with now. Why is he calling?

311
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:43,972
Hey, Sa Hye-jun.

312
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:45,556
How's it going?

313
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:48,476
<i>Not good. How did you know?</i>

314
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:51,729
Let's meet. Come to our usual spot.

315
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:54,524
I'm sorry I've been neglecting you guys.

316
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:03,908
JJAMPPONG ENTERTAINMENT

317
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:15,503
Come in.

318
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:30,101
I'm stepping out for a while.

319
00:17:30,184 --> 00:17:31,894
Call me when you're done.

320
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:33,980
Okay.

321
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:45,700
Have a seat.

322
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:48,661
The office is smaller than I expected.

323
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:52,832
-You should move to a bigger space.
-This is the right size for us.

324
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:56,961
Do you want some tea?

325
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,262
I don't want you

326
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:09,474
to come back into my life.

327
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,645
I always do the opposite of what you want.
And that's how I tested your love.

328
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:17,857
It took me a while to realize
that was your way of testing me.

329
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:21,402
And I concluded I couldn't put up
with being tested all the time.

330
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,364
Let's relax around each other now.

331
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:29,077
Now, I know
that we can't get back together.

332
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:34,665
And I've also accepted the fact
that we can't even be friends.

333
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:37,543
Thanks.

334
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:41,839
I was very happy to see you doing so well.

335
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:44,509
But I'm the only one who can destroy you.

336
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:49,472
I cannot allow others to harm you.

337
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:51,349
So?

338
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:57,271
Well, I proved
that Sa Hye-jun likes women.

339
00:18:57,897 --> 00:18:59,607
I was happy I could do that for you.

340
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:02,360
I'm no longer indebted to you.

341
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:05,029
I didn't know you thought

342
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:06,864
you were indebted to me.

343
00:19:12,203 --> 00:19:14,122
I have a heart too.

344
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:16,833
You seem to think
that I'm a horrible person.

345
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,002
I did many things
to make you think that about me,

346
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,046
but I regret it now.

347
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,049
Back then, I thought
I was being considerate of you.

348
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,406
Your skin turns red
at the slightest touch.

349
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:39,452
You have combination skin
that is also very sensitive.

350
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:41,912
The lack of sleep is making it worse.

351
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:43,998
It's your wedding anniversary.

352
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:47,585
You're doing a photo shoot,
so I understand why you're nervous.

353
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:52,548
I'll apply some calming cream first.

354
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:04,894
I love this one-client setup.

355
00:20:04,977 --> 00:20:06,479
I feel like a princess.

356
00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:08,606
Please visit us often.

357
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:11,358
I hope you don't become too famous

358
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:12,693
so this can be my secret.

359
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:16,071
Thank you. I'll take that as a compliment.

360
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:22,953
HAE-HYO

361
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:28,083
1.1 MILLION FOLLOWERS

362
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:33,255
You look very comfortable.

363
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:35,841
Is this your office?

364
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:39,220
No, it's not.

365
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,306
But you pay all the expenses
with the money that I earn.

366
00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:45,142
<i>That prick is trying to take credit
for everything again.</i>

367
00:20:48,604 --> 00:20:50,815
-It's just so odd.
-What?

368
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:53,651
Hae-hyo's follower count. It's too high.

369
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:55,569
It's none of your business.

370
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,905
I tend to pry
when I'm fixated on something.

371
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:02,034
If he'd hired one of those companies
like you said, then I'd understand.

372
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:06,455
Okay, let's say he did.
But why is that any of your business?

373
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,123
He's too perfect.

374
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:13,254
That comfortable, well-off vibe he exudes
bothers me.

375
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:16,507
As you know,
my self-esteem has hit rock bottom.

376
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,884
I'll feel much better
if he turns out to be someone

377
00:21:18,968 --> 00:21:20,803
who resorts to such tricks to get ahead.

378
00:21:20,886 --> 00:21:23,264
"Rich people are not all that different."

379
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:27,810
In that sense, I guess popularity is fair.

380
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:29,562
It's not something you can buy.

381
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:31,647
My gut tells me that he did it.

382
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:43,742
Oh, you're still here.

383
00:21:44,994 --> 00:21:47,079
<i>Gosh, Won Hae-na…</i>

384
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:49,623
I'll put the side dishes in the fridge.

385
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:52,668
Please let me know what to make next.

386
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:55,337
<i>I must tell her to quit.</i>

387
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:01,218
Jin-u's mother is a good cook.

388
00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:03,137
It's seasoned perfectly.

389
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,888
And it tastes light and clean.

390
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:08,434
That's why I'm putting up with a lot.

391
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:10,060
Just so you can eat good food.

392
00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:12,771
Thank you so very much.
Keep on putting up with her, then.

393
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:19,194
Where's the list?

394
00:22:19,778 --> 00:22:21,739
<i>I have to tell her to quit.</i>

395
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:26,160
What's in season now? I don't have
much of an appetite these days.

396
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,954
Well…

397
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:31,999
How about something spicy?
<i>Deodeok</i> seasoned with gochujang.

398
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:36,253
Don't use gochujang.

399
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:38,380
Grill it with some sweet rice flour.

400
00:22:40,174 --> 00:22:43,552
Why don't you make it here?
It's best when it's fresh.

401
00:22:43,636 --> 00:22:46,263
-What about braised semi-dried pollock?
-I'd love that!

402
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:51,060
<i>What? You can't tell her to quit
because of these side dishes?</i>

403
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,312
I make really good braised monkfish.

404
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:55,939
My gosh!
Now, I'm craving braised monkfish.

405
00:22:56,815 --> 00:22:58,400
I'll make some for you.

406
00:22:58,484 --> 00:23:01,820
Delicious food
is the best remedy for stress.

407
00:23:03,197 --> 00:23:04,323
Why would I be stressed?

408
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:05,366
You're not?

409
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:07,368
No, I'm not.

410
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:10,579
You're too quick to make assumptions.

411
00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:12,623
Bad press is better than no press.

412
00:23:12,706 --> 00:23:15,292
No one talks about Hae-hyo,
so I thought you'd be upset.

413
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:17,211
No, it's the opposite.

414
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:20,589
Also, stop comparing Hae-hyo with Hye-jun.

415
00:23:20,673 --> 00:23:23,258
Hae-hyo can do something else
if this doesn't work out.

416
00:23:23,342 --> 00:23:24,385
He has many options.

417
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:27,054
"Option"? What is that?

418
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:30,224
I mean, he has many choices.

419
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:33,310
I see. You could've worded it like that
in the first place.

420
00:23:33,394 --> 00:23:36,146
I didn't understand what you meant.
I should use that word.

421
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,065
Anyway, take care.

422
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:42,653
<i>I must tell her.</i>

423
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:45,406
Don't come back.

424
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,036
I've said it.

425
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,580
It's her fault for not hearing me
and coming back.

426
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:02,631
I guess you're not that busy.

427
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:06,218
I told her, and she wants to meet you.

428
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:07,928
That actress I mentioned.

429
00:24:08,637 --> 00:24:10,139
Thanks. Who is it?

430
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:13,851
-I'll give you her number.
-My gosh.

431
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,646
This big brother always does
something for you.

432
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,065
But look at you.
Even now, I made time to come here.

433
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:22,985
And what? "I guess you're not that busy"?

434
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:26,864
I'm not sorry anymore.
I want to tease you again.

435
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:30,033
-"Big brother"? When's your birthday?
-September 27. When's yours?

436
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:31,577
November 4.

437
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,203
Hi, big bro.

438
00:24:33,287 --> 00:24:34,329
Hey, don't do that.

439
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,123
Jeez.

440
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:38,876
-Let's go eat.
-I have to go home.

441
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,545
Why do you always say that
when you see me?

442
00:24:41,628 --> 00:24:42,921
Why today of all days?

443
00:24:43,005 --> 00:24:45,132
I have to get ready for my live broadcast.

444
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:47,676
Are you going to be a YouTuber today?

445
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,511
You don't even have many subscribers.

446
00:24:49,595 --> 00:24:52,806
It's because I'm not focusing on it,
and I don't plan to.

447
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,935
I'm just going to treat it as my diary
and use it to communicate with others.

448
00:24:58,353 --> 00:25:00,147
What will you talk about today?

449
00:25:00,814 --> 00:25:02,357
Watch it later if you're curious.

450
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:10,908
Did you see Hye-jun?

451
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:15,579
I did, but I'm not happy.

452
00:25:15,662 --> 00:25:18,332
He's neglecting his friends
because of his girlfriend.

453
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,376
Way to go, Hye-jun.

454
00:25:24,254 --> 00:25:25,756
When did you see him?

455
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:28,967
I've just been texting him.

456
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:33,096
I know he's busy and tired,
so I don't want to ask him to meet up.

457
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,349
And I don't want to ask him
about the rumors.

458
00:25:35,432 --> 00:25:38,101
Why can't you?
You said your relationship is solid.

459
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:42,356
I'm just waiting for him to tell me first.

460
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:45,275
I was never good at waiting,
but I've changed.

461
00:25:48,612 --> 00:25:49,947
I guess you love him.

462
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:52,115
That's what love does to you.

463
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:54,159
You begin to like things you couldn't do.

464
00:25:56,495 --> 00:25:59,081
Why are you single
when you know so much about love?

465
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:00,082
You're so naive.

466
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:03,836
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

467
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,004
It's Hye-jun's job, but I'll do it.

468
00:26:06,088 --> 00:26:07,881
I'd never make him do it.

469
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:09,466
I'd just tell him to go home and rest.

470
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:13,262
Hurry up.

471
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:14,346
Okay.

472
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:18,308
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

473
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:26,525
It's so refreshing.

474
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:29,653
It's been so long since I last drank.

475
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:31,905
You've been working too hard.

476
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:34,491
Are you a workaholic now?
You never take a break.

477
00:26:34,575 --> 00:26:36,285
Working relaxes me.

478
00:26:37,202 --> 00:26:39,288
I want to work a lot while I'm in my 20s.

479
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:40,747
Right.

480
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:43,333
After we serve in the military
and turn 30,

481
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:44,960
things will be different.

482
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:48,463
Gosh, the military. When should I enlist?

483
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:52,509
Hey, you have to postpone it
as much as you can.

484
00:26:52,593 --> 00:26:54,052
Work while you can.

485
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:56,972
Your next show… Yes, <i>The First Human</i>!

486
00:26:57,472 --> 00:26:58,724
That's one grand title.

487
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,936
You'll see Hae-hyo often
because you're both in it.

488
00:27:03,729 --> 00:27:05,689
I was excited to work with him,

489
00:27:07,357 --> 00:27:09,484
but he snapped at me earlier.

490
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:10,861
I'm sure you did too.

491
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:12,571
Right, I did.

492
00:27:13,822 --> 00:27:15,657
It's nice having childhood friends.

493
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:17,993
Why did you snap at him?

494
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:20,078
Because of Ji-a's interview.

495
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,416
But what if

496
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,503
Jeong-ha sees that interview?

497
00:27:36,762 --> 00:27:38,055
Why are you following me?

498
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:41,308
I don't want to talk to you.

499
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:44,686
I'm going to keep trying to talk to you.

500
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,979
Did you see this?

501
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:48,357
It's an exclusive interview with Ji-a.

502
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,609
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
WITH SA HYE-JUN'S EX-GIRLFRIEND

503
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:53,570
I guess Hye-jun really is popular.
An exclusive at this hour?

504
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:55,948
I know. What were you up to?

505
00:27:56,782 --> 00:27:58,575
I'll watch Jeong-ha's live broadcast.

506
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:00,452
LIVE BROADCAST NOTIFICATION

507
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:03,038
The broadcast is called "confession."

508
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:04,665
What is she confessing?

509
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:06,541
I don't know.

510
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:07,584
LIVE BROADCAST

511
00:28:07,668 --> 00:28:09,169
It's a live broadcast.

512
00:28:10,337 --> 00:28:14,967
It sounds grand since I titled
the broadcast, "confession."

513
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:17,594
"Is it about your boyfriend?"

514
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:21,181
Is she going to talk about Hye-jun?

515
00:28:22,975 --> 00:28:24,851
Is it about my boyfriend?

516
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:26,853
Yes, it is.

517
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:29,273
HYE-JUN

518
00:28:30,482 --> 00:28:32,693
Let me pause for a second.
I'll be back shortly.

519
00:28:44,162 --> 00:28:45,664
Hey, Hye-jun.

520
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:46,707
<i>I'm sorry, Jeong-ha.</i>

521
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,418
Why are you apologizing to me?

522
00:28:49,501 --> 00:28:51,878
I want to tell you the full story
in person.

523
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:53,797
There's an article about me.

524
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,425
I should've given you a heads-up
before it was published.

525
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,136
I only found out after the interview.

526
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,807
What is the article about?
And who did the interview?

527
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:14,693
Where is everyone?

528
00:29:15,277 --> 00:29:16,820
THEY LEFT TO WATCH THE INTERVIEW
WITH SA-HYE JUN'S EX

529
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:20,449
I see.

530
00:29:25,245 --> 00:29:27,456
WHO'S YOUR BOYFRIEND?
WEREN'T YOU GOING TO TELL US?

531
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:35,589
Right. I wanted to tell you guys
that you are my boyfriends.

532
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:41,011
To show my appreciation, I'd like
to give away a voucher for my studio.

533
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:45,307
Let's go. You should call Hae-hyo.

534
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:47,893
-Now?
-Yes. Let's make up today.

535
00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:50,270
Both of us shouldn't drag this out.

536
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:02,574
-Be careful.
-Yes.

537
00:30:02,657 --> 00:30:04,951
Can you take a photo with us?

538
00:30:05,744 --> 00:30:07,662
If you promise not to post it online.

539
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:08,747
We won't.

540
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,540
-That's a promise.
-Yes.

541
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:14,294
One, two, three.

542
00:30:16,546 --> 00:30:19,007
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

543
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:27,099
HIS FACE IS TINY AND HAS PERFECT SKIN

544
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:30,352
HE SEEMED TO LIKE TO DRINK
HE WAS WITH HIS BOYFRIEND

545
00:30:30,435 --> 00:30:31,937
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
WITH SA HYE-JUN'S EX-GIRLFRIEND

546
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,064
WE DATED IN COLLEGE
HE IS NOT GAY

547
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:45,200
<i>He doesn't know
that I'm doing this interview.</i>

548
00:30:45,283 --> 00:30:47,327
<i>If he knew, he would have stopped me.</i>

549
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:51,456
<i>He hates to inconvenience others
for his sake.</i>

550
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,377
He was a good person and a good boyfriend.

551
00:30:59,756 --> 00:31:04,428
<i>I wanted to tell people that he wouldn't
do anything that deserves any criticism.</i>

552
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:07,097
I'm so grateful to her.

553
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,641
His ex is helpful,
and has a new girlfriend. Lucky him.

554
00:31:09,724 --> 00:31:11,101
You're still single, right?

555
00:31:11,184 --> 00:31:12,394
Yes, I am.

556
00:31:12,477 --> 00:31:13,562
Don't sound so proud.

557
00:31:13,645 --> 00:31:16,606
You have a job now.
Why are you still single?

558
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,650
He never dated even in school.

559
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:22,487
Dad, you're upsetting me these days.

560
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:24,698
You don't love me as much as you used to.

561
00:31:24,781 --> 00:31:26,491
I bet Hye-jun gave you money.

562
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:33,331
Why won't you answer me?

563
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:35,292
Why not?

564
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:53,685
SA HYE-JUN HAS TRANSFERRED MONEY
TO HAN AE-SUK

565
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:04,988
<i>Do you remember?</i>

566
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:07,574
<i>When I was in middle school,</i>

567
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:09,367
<i>I promised if I made a lot of money,</i>

568
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:11,453
<i>I would give you a comfortable life.</i>

569
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:14,831
<i>I didn't forget my promise.</i>

570
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:19,377
<i>When I grow up, I'll earn a lot of money,
so you can live comfortably.</i>

571
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:21,254
<i>I'll do the same.</i>

572
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:24,382
<i>I'll give you all the support you need
so you can do what you want.</i>

573
00:32:38,605 --> 00:32:40,273
I thought you were cooking.

574
00:32:40,815 --> 00:32:42,067
Are you crying?

575
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:47,614
What's this?

576
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:50,867
We'll be able to pay off the debt.

577
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:52,911
And we'll have some left.

578
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,625
I could never make this much money
even if I worked all my life.

579
00:32:59,918 --> 00:33:01,962
He earned this much money in a year.

580
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:05,006
It took more than a year.

581
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:09,177
Think about everything
he had to go through for this.

582
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,638
That breaks my heart.

583
00:33:13,223 --> 00:33:15,183
He didn't forget his promise to me.

584
00:33:16,351 --> 00:33:17,519
When he told me

585
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:21,481
he was going to help me live comfortably
once he grew up,

586
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:24,734
I said I would give him

587
00:33:24,818 --> 00:33:28,029
all the support he needed
to do whatever he wanted.

588
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:32,117
But I couldn't keep my promise.

589
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:35,328
I don't want to take this money.

590
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,513
Father, are you going to sleep now?

591
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:55,223
Yes, I am.

592
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:58,143
Do you have Hye-jun's agent's number?

593
00:33:59,436 --> 00:34:00,812
I have her business card. Why?

594
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:03,064
Do you know what Gyeong-jun just said?

595
00:34:03,565 --> 00:34:06,067
Do you really think nothing happened
between them?

596
00:34:06,151 --> 00:34:09,237
I mean, this rumor
must have started from somewhere.

597
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:13,199
Instead of blindly siding with him,
we must see if it's reasonable to doubt.

598
00:34:13,283 --> 00:34:15,535
You're his brother.
How could you say that?

599
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:17,454
Think about how others would think.

600
00:34:17,537 --> 00:34:19,581
His agency isn't dealing properly, too.

601
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:25,420
We should pressure his agency.

602
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:27,005
Don't do that.

603
00:34:27,505 --> 00:34:29,174
What do you mean, Father?

604
00:34:29,257 --> 00:34:31,176
Don't pressure his agency.

605
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:33,511
Just stick to
what you've been doing so far.

606
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:35,263
It will only get on his nerves.

607
00:34:35,972 --> 00:34:38,850
Out of all people, you should be
the last person to do so.

608
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:54,699
-Hello?
-Hi.

609
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:56,493
This is Hye-jun's father.

610
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:58,161
Hello, sir.

611
00:34:58,703 --> 00:35:01,456
I called because I had some questions.

612
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:02,916
Sure. Go ahead.

613
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,629
When does Hye-jun's contract
with the agency mature?

614
00:35:07,712 --> 00:35:10,632
<i>He's not home yet,
so I'm asking you directly.</i>

615
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:14,803
I see. I didn't think
to check the contract.

616
00:35:14,886 --> 00:35:17,347
It has already matured.
It was a one-year contract.

617
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,849
<i>We have to renew the contract now.</i>

618
00:35:20,558 --> 00:35:23,103
But when we drew up the contract,
there was a clause that

619
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:25,397
we could end the contract
if one of us isn't happy.

620
00:35:26,648 --> 00:35:30,360
Did Hye-jun say he was unhappy
with his contract?

621
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:31,986
Did he?

622
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:35,573
What did Jeong-ha say?

623
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:38,451
What do you think?

624
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:40,704
She probably feels awful.

625
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,959
Shouldn't you see her instead of Hae-hyo?

626
00:35:47,877 --> 00:35:49,170
You know what?

627
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:53,466
The less my affection is,
the less humiliated I feel.

628
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:56,344
What?

629
00:35:56,428 --> 00:35:59,764
The way they're spreading rumors about me

630
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:03,017
is embarrassing.

631
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,228
It makes me feel naked.

632
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:09,107
Back then,

633
00:36:09,774 --> 00:36:12,652
whatever happened to me,
my family didn't know about it

634
00:36:12,736 --> 00:36:14,070
before I told them.

635
00:36:14,154 --> 00:36:15,238
Right.

636
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:18,575
But now, they know it
even before I tell them.

637
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:20,702
They worry about me.

638
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:25,081
I don't know why that's hurting
my self-esteem.

639
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:28,251
Is that why you got mad at Hae-hyo?

640
00:36:29,586 --> 00:36:31,921
But I don't feel that embarrassed
in front of him.

641
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:33,047
He gets hate comments, too.

642
00:36:33,923 --> 00:36:35,550
We're in the same boat,
so it doesn't bother me.

643
00:36:38,303 --> 00:36:41,681
Tell me you're embarrassed in front of me.
That means you love me, right?

644
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:43,475
Crazy jerk. Get away from me.

645
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:48,229
Don't be so harsh on me.
Hae-hyo might beat me up later.

646
00:36:50,356 --> 00:36:51,566
I see Hae-hyo over there.

647
00:36:54,569 --> 00:36:55,612
You're dead meat.

648
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:23,097
-What's up?
-You sure took your time.

649
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:26,601
Did you know that I knew? Or didn't you?

650
00:37:26,684 --> 00:37:29,229
-I knew.
-How can you think about dating my sister?

651
00:37:30,355 --> 00:37:31,981
I didn't think much, you know.

652
00:37:33,107 --> 00:37:36,361
-Right. You never think, do you?
-Yes.

653
00:37:36,444 --> 00:37:38,196
Didn't you think to tell me?

654
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:39,864
No way. So you could beat me up?

655
00:37:40,865 --> 00:37:43,368
So you were expecting it.
Let me punch you first.

656
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:45,203
Okay. Which side? Right or left?

657
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:49,040
Damn it.

658
00:37:49,123 --> 00:37:52,919
Hey, Hye-jun. Save me.
He's going to kill me!

659
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:53,920
Where's Hye-jun?

660
00:37:55,922 --> 00:37:56,923
He's not here?

661
00:37:58,007 --> 00:37:59,217
He's here somewhere.

662
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:02,679
He said he needed to make up
with you in person.

663
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:03,805
Really?

664
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,224
Is he sorry about throwing a tantrum?

665
00:38:44,637 --> 00:38:45,972
I can smell alcohol on you.

666
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:48,099
I had a few drinks.

667
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:52,020
I just opened a cold one. Do you want one?

668
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:54,188
Yes. I'll get it.

669
00:39:01,112 --> 00:39:02,238
How did you get here?

670
00:39:02,822 --> 00:39:05,658
I took a cab. I drank with Jin-u.

671
00:39:07,243 --> 00:39:10,204
The guys were not happy with me.

672
00:39:11,331 --> 00:39:14,667
They feel neglected because I've been
paying attention only to you.

673
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:18,171
That's what Hae-hyo said earlier.

674
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:22,550
You saw him?

675
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:25,219
Yes, he stopped by my studio.

676
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:28,139
I'm really grateful to him.

677
00:39:29,223 --> 00:39:31,559
He'll set me up with a famous actress.

678
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:36,230
I want to prepare myself thoroughly,
so I can be her makeup artist.

679
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:39,233
Hae-hyo might win you over.

680
00:39:43,488 --> 00:39:45,531
That won't happen.

681
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:47,408
You're always my top priority.

682
00:39:52,747 --> 00:39:54,999
-I love you.
-I double-love you.

683
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,713
I have a business trip next week.

684
00:40:00,797 --> 00:40:04,175
I'm doing Kim So-rang's makeup
for her movie.

685
00:40:04,258 --> 00:40:06,761
I was able to get a celebrity client
all on my own.

686
00:40:07,553 --> 00:40:08,554
Congratulations.

687
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,520
Did you watch Ji-a's interview?

688
00:40:20,608 --> 00:40:21,609
I did.

689
00:40:22,902 --> 00:40:23,987
It didn't feel good.

690
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:26,906
I'm telling you before you ask me.

691
00:40:28,074 --> 00:40:30,785
Thank you for saving us some time.

692
00:40:32,286 --> 00:40:34,247
-She's pretty.
-Not as pretty as you.

693
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,832
So she is pretty, then.

694
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:39,085
-I'm sorry.
-I like that you apologized quickly.

695
00:40:44,132 --> 00:40:45,216
Well,

696
00:40:46,217 --> 00:40:48,469
when something like this happens,

697
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:50,722
why do you not discuss it with me?

698
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:56,269
Why did you make me worry all by myself?

699
00:40:58,938 --> 00:41:01,149
You're very calm when you get angry.

700
00:41:01,232 --> 00:41:03,526
That's a good thing. It's scarier.

701
00:41:08,406 --> 00:41:11,701
I want to show and tell you
only the good things.

702
00:41:11,784 --> 00:41:13,745
-I want--
-Am I your kid?

703
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:22,837
That's what parents tell their children.

704
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:28,384
I can put up with those hateful comments
because they aren't true.

705
00:41:28,468 --> 00:41:29,677
But

706
00:41:30,261 --> 00:41:32,555
I don't want my family or you to find out.

707
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,268
The fact that the people I love
have seen those comments

708
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:41,606
hurts my self-esteem.

709
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:46,694
The people you love

710
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,031
want to share your burden with you.

711
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:56,788
You only disappoint them
by hiding it from them.

712
00:42:28,486 --> 00:42:29,946
I love you

713
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,699
more than you think.

714
00:43:02,423 --> 00:43:04,133
SA HYE-JUN CONFIRMED
TO STAR IN <i>THE FIRST HUMAN</i>

715
00:43:08,554 --> 00:43:10,639
A NEW PROJECT ALREADY?
HE'S GREEDY FOR MONEY

716
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:12,808
IS HE REALLY NOT GAY? THE DEAD CAN'T SPEAK

717
00:43:12,892 --> 00:43:14,935
WHO KNOWS?
THE INTERVIEW MIGHT BE STAGED

718
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:17,521
People just believe
whatever they want to believe.

719
00:43:18,105 --> 00:43:19,982
The interview didn't help at all.

720
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:23,527
Why did Hye-jun's father want to see you?

721
00:43:24,487 --> 00:43:27,323
I don't know. Is Hye-jun up?

722
00:44:01,482 --> 00:44:03,651
I hope our meeting
wasn't too early for you.

723
00:44:03,734 --> 00:44:05,986
It's fine. I just left
a few minutes earlier than usual.

724
00:44:07,363 --> 00:44:09,573
You didn't have breakfast, right?

725
00:44:09,657 --> 00:44:12,409
-Have some of this.
-Thank you.

726
00:44:12,493 --> 00:44:14,453
I hope it's to your liking.

727
00:44:14,537 --> 00:44:15,621
I like everything.

728
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:21,961
You're already here.

729
00:44:22,044 --> 00:44:23,170
Yes.

730
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:25,840
He wanted to talk to me.

731
00:44:26,799 --> 00:44:27,925
About what?

732
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:29,927
You can talk to me.

733
00:44:30,553 --> 00:44:34,473
I was just curious about how she is
handling those vicious comments.

734
00:44:35,683 --> 00:44:37,226
There's nothing to worry about.

735
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:38,519
Did you file a lawsuit?

736
00:44:39,854 --> 00:44:41,605
We kept finding more comments.

737
00:44:41,689 --> 00:44:45,359
As we can't gather all of them at once,
we'll file the first lawsuit for now.

738
00:44:45,442 --> 00:44:49,572
I see. That's what's happening.
People don't know anything.

739
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:51,031
Did they say something?

740
00:44:51,115 --> 00:44:53,742
Well, you know, I just read some comments.

741
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,329
You're here, Ms. Lee.

742
00:44:57,413 --> 00:44:58,622
-Hello.
-Hi.

743
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:02,167
-Ms. Lee.
-Yes.

744
00:45:03,502 --> 00:45:05,546
Can you drop me off at work on your way?

745
00:45:06,755 --> 00:45:07,965
Gyeong-jun.

746
00:45:08,591 --> 00:45:11,385
She's my agent, not yours.
You should leave now.

747
00:45:11,468 --> 00:45:13,888
You're so rigid. I'll get going.

748
00:45:13,971 --> 00:45:15,764
-See you around.
-Have a good day.

749
00:45:15,848 --> 00:45:16,807
Thanks.

750
00:45:22,938 --> 00:45:24,315
-Dad.
-Yes?

751
00:45:24,398 --> 00:45:25,774
Can I talk to you?

752
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,372
Dad,

753
00:45:40,956 --> 00:45:43,918
I know that you're concerned,
but I can handle this by myself.

754
00:45:45,002 --> 00:45:48,130
Of course. I know that you can handle it.

755
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:49,590
I was just worried.

756
00:45:49,673 --> 00:45:51,216
Min-jae is my agent.

757
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,594
She believed in me when I had nothing,

758
00:45:53,677 --> 00:45:55,638
and she works hard to keep me motivated.

759
00:45:55,721 --> 00:45:56,972
I'm not arguing with it.

760
00:45:57,056 --> 00:45:59,058
Let me be the person who talks to her.

761
00:46:00,142 --> 00:46:01,769
I don't want to hurt her.

762
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:03,979
<i>Treat me like that, too.</i>

763
00:46:05,898 --> 00:46:07,024
Okay.

764
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,951
Gosh. He sounds like the CEO of an agency.

765
00:46:18,077 --> 00:46:20,287
Why can't I argue with him?

766
00:46:20,996 --> 00:46:21,956
Why not?

767
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:23,582
Why can't I?

768
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,292
Why is that?

769
00:46:26,001 --> 00:46:27,211
Gosh.

770
00:46:32,132 --> 00:46:33,008
Ma'am.

771
00:46:34,468 --> 00:46:36,220
Goodness, it's been a while, Hae-hyo.

772
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,348
You're so busy that
I don't get to see you when I come.

773
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:41,433
I heard you're in a series with Hye-jun.

774
00:46:41,517 --> 00:46:45,145
Yes. He has the leading role,
and I have the supporting role.

775
00:46:45,229 --> 00:46:47,022
It doesn't matter who has the lead.

776
00:46:47,106 --> 00:46:48,190
Only the roles matter.

777
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:51,068
Looking at Hye-jun,
fame really does happen overnight.

778
00:46:51,151 --> 00:46:53,153
He woke up one day to find himself famous.

779
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:55,906
That can happen to you, too.

780
00:46:56,699 --> 00:46:57,658
Thank you.

781
00:46:58,617 --> 00:46:59,785
Where is my mom?

782
00:46:59,868 --> 00:47:01,578
She went out. She's meeting someone.

783
00:47:02,413 --> 00:47:05,332
But she didn't seem excited
about the meeting.

784
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:13,007
Stop.

785
00:47:15,634 --> 00:47:17,094
I don't want to eat with you.

786
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,680
Why must we talk over a meal?

787
00:47:20,556 --> 00:47:24,309
You know, I never forget
to give credit where credit's due.

788
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:27,104
Ms. Kim, thanks to you,

789
00:47:27,187 --> 00:47:30,733
I met Mr. Yoon and got a big return.
I ought to show my appreciation.

790
00:47:31,775 --> 00:47:34,028
If you truly mean that,
don't pick and choose.

791
00:47:34,111 --> 00:47:35,988
You must be honest with every situation.

792
00:47:36,655 --> 00:47:39,992
Park Do-ha was the one
who got Hae-hyo in <i>Catch</i>.

793
00:47:40,701 --> 00:47:42,327
I am very offended.

794
00:47:42,828 --> 00:47:44,204
Why did you lie to me?

795
00:47:44,288 --> 00:47:46,790
I won't be making
any more introductions to you.

796
00:47:47,374 --> 00:47:49,918
It was only a friendly prank
to get close to you,

797
00:47:50,002 --> 00:47:52,337
so I can't believe
you took me for my word.

798
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:54,882
Life is full of deceptions.

799
00:47:54,965 --> 00:47:57,634
People only realize it
when they're the victims.

800
00:47:57,718 --> 00:48:01,305
Hae-hyo has an extremely high number
of followers on social media.

801
00:48:03,098 --> 00:48:04,391
<i>What is he getting at?</i>

802
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,979
What does him
being popular on social media have

803
00:48:09,063 --> 00:48:10,314
anything to do with this?

804
00:48:10,397 --> 00:48:12,066
You know how that's possible.

805
00:48:12,775 --> 00:48:15,235
I've bought them with money before too.

806
00:48:16,195 --> 00:48:18,614
Quite simple, isn't it?
It only takes a few clicks.

807
00:48:22,576 --> 00:48:23,577
<i>As if I'd admit to it.</i>

808
00:48:24,161 --> 00:48:25,996
How should I know if it's simple or not?

809
00:48:26,747 --> 00:48:28,665
I agreed to meet you

810
00:48:28,749 --> 00:48:31,752
only because I'm a decent human being
even though I didn't want to.

811
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:35,506
-Our relationship ends here.
-No can do.

812
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,966
I'll be good, I-yeong.

813
00:48:38,634 --> 00:48:39,843
What did you call me?

814
00:48:39,927 --> 00:48:42,179
You're too young and pretty
to be called "ma'am."

815
00:48:42,262 --> 00:48:44,348
Who'd guess that you're Hae-hyo's mom?

816
00:48:44,848 --> 00:48:46,892
You think I'm some pushover, don't you?

817
00:48:47,684 --> 00:48:50,729
If you thought you could
laugh things over with me,

818
00:48:50,813 --> 00:48:53,107
I urge you to reconsider. Re-evaluate.

819
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:55,526
Got it.

820
00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:59,404
I'll re-evaluate my situation
and do my best to get on your good side.

821
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:09,164
After the interview,
you're needed in Gangnam.

822
00:49:09,248 --> 00:49:10,457
What do you want to eat?

823
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:12,501
Something light.

824
00:49:12,584 --> 00:49:14,378
A sandwich and melon smoothie then.

825
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,463
<i>Today, I'm here with Sa Hye-jun,</i>

826
00:49:16,547 --> 00:49:19,133
one of the hottest actors
that's been trending.

827
00:49:19,216 --> 00:49:22,553
Can you greet the viewers
of <i>Memory Talk Talk</i>?

828
00:49:23,554 --> 00:49:25,389
Hello, I'm actor Sa Hye-jun.

829
00:49:25,472 --> 00:49:29,143
This is your first interview following
your Best Actor Award last year.

830
00:49:29,226 --> 00:49:30,060
Right.

831
00:49:30,144 --> 00:49:33,105
Aren't you here to promote
your new series <i>The First Human</i>?

832
00:49:33,188 --> 00:49:34,356
I am.

833
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:37,151
<i>The First Human</i> deals with
the power struggle and romance

834
00:49:37,234 --> 00:49:39,319
of young adults born
into prestigious families.

835
00:49:39,903 --> 00:49:42,614
You're known for your dreamy gazes.

836
00:49:42,698 --> 00:49:45,075
I'm curious about how you'll portray

837
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:47,995
the romance between you
and your partner Jin Seo-u.

838
00:49:48,078 --> 00:49:49,121
How will it be?

839
00:49:49,204 --> 00:49:50,455
It's too early to say,

840
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:52,541
but I'm curious
about our chemistry as well

841
00:49:52,624 --> 00:49:54,877
since we used to model together.

842
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:58,607
Don't come any closer.

843
00:51:03,445 --> 00:51:04,529
We…

844
00:51:05,489 --> 00:51:06,323
broke up.

845
00:51:07,658 --> 00:51:08,700
Did you forget that?

846
00:51:22,256 --> 00:51:23,298
I knew it.

847
00:51:24,967 --> 00:51:26,218
You can't live without me.

848
00:51:39,815 --> 00:51:42,484
<i>Cut.</i> We'll take a short break.

849
00:51:45,237 --> 00:51:47,948
It sure is awkward
to do scenes like this with you.

850
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:49,950
"You can't live without me."

851
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:52,035
-Stop it.
-Stop what?

852
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:54,121
You haven't changed at all.

853
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:55,872
Likewise.

854
00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:00,752
-You're glistening a bit.
-I had to dance, remember?

855
00:52:01,253 --> 00:52:03,922
My regular makeup artist
took her maternity leave.

856
00:52:04,006 --> 00:52:05,924
Someone new took over,

857
00:52:06,008 --> 00:52:07,676
but she's not considerate enough.

858
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,388
Then can I introduce you
to a makeup artist

859
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:14,182
who is skilled with her hands
and warm at heart?

860
00:52:16,935 --> 00:52:18,729
Are you vouching for your girlfriend?

861
00:52:19,396 --> 00:52:20,731
-How did you know?
-A hunch.

862
00:52:24,526 --> 00:52:26,320
-Give me her number then.
-Sure.

863
00:52:26,903 --> 00:52:29,781
-I guess you'll need your phone.
-I have it memorized.

864
00:52:30,365 --> 00:52:31,992
Well, hello, lover boy.

865
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,415
Are you filming tomorrow?

866
00:52:38,498 --> 00:52:40,500
-I'll be at it with Hae-hyo.
-Hae-hyo?

867
00:52:41,126 --> 00:52:43,920
Oh, right.
Won't it get physical between you two?

868
00:52:44,004 --> 00:52:45,756
I'll be beating him up.

869
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,841
I'd love to come by and watch.

870
00:52:47,924 --> 00:52:49,634
-You should.
-Can I?

871
00:52:50,802 --> 00:52:52,429
But won't you lose in a fight?

872
00:52:52,512 --> 00:52:54,806
What? Why do you always say that?

873
00:53:00,729 --> 00:53:02,522
Aren't you exhausted?

874
00:53:02,606 --> 00:53:04,399
Even on a tight schedule,

875
00:53:04,483 --> 00:53:06,526
your face keeps glowing.

876
00:53:07,194 --> 00:53:08,445
Maybe it's the red ginseng.

877
00:53:09,404 --> 00:53:11,656
You were born this way, Mr. Workaholic.

878
00:53:12,783 --> 00:53:15,327
He's heading overseas
for his fan meet-up event tomorrow.

879
00:53:15,911 --> 00:53:18,663
-So?
-You called him a workaholic,

880
00:53:18,747 --> 00:53:20,540
so I thought I'd recite his schedule.

881
00:53:20,624 --> 00:53:22,292
I'm filming later at night too.

882
00:53:22,376 --> 00:53:24,294
I thought I'd recite my schedule too.

883
00:53:24,378 --> 00:53:25,379
It feels good to say it.

884
00:53:27,923 --> 00:53:30,092
Can you stop eating? You'll gain weight.

885
00:53:33,845 --> 00:53:35,931
-How about slicked back hair?
-Yes, let's.

886
00:53:44,314 --> 00:53:46,358
-We need to get going.
-Sure.

887
00:54:00,914 --> 00:54:02,165
<i>Gyeoksejigam</i> is the word.

888
00:54:02,249 --> 00:54:03,750
What does that mean?

889
00:54:05,252 --> 00:54:08,463
Being astonished
at how much things have changed.

890
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:11,675
It's used in situations where

891
00:54:11,758 --> 00:54:14,845
you feel like decades have passed
because the change is too drastic.

892
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:17,597
Yes, that's the one.

893
00:54:18,432 --> 00:54:20,851
-You weren't sure?
-I knew the gist of it.

894
00:54:22,102 --> 00:54:23,353
He sure has made it big.

895
00:54:24,146 --> 00:54:25,814
The sight of him is blinding now.

896
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:30,735
Filming will begin in ten minutes!

897
00:54:31,403 --> 00:54:32,737
Got it.

898
00:54:33,488 --> 00:54:35,657
-He needs to get going.
-I'm almost done.

899
00:54:39,536 --> 00:54:40,662
Hye-jun.

900
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:45,584
Hey, Hae-hyo.

901
00:54:46,835 --> 00:54:49,796
-You made your big brother come to you.
-You're the younger one.

902
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,591
Jeong-ha came with me today.
She's the only help I have.

903
00:54:53,633 --> 00:54:54,885
Hi.

904
00:54:55,927 --> 00:54:56,803
Hi.

905
00:54:58,472 --> 00:54:59,848
Hi, Jeong-ha.

906
00:54:59,931 --> 00:55:02,601
-Oh, hey.
-I've been doing well in your place.

907
00:55:03,477 --> 00:55:04,644
I see. Is that so?

908
00:55:05,645 --> 00:55:06,897
Well, let's get going.

909
00:55:12,152 --> 00:55:14,321
Jeong-ha, could we talk?

910
00:55:23,872 --> 00:55:26,625
Were you shocked
to see Yeong-jin in your place?

911
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:29,878
Hye-jun didn't ask me
for today's shooting,

912
00:55:29,961 --> 00:55:31,379
so I figured.

913
00:55:32,631 --> 00:55:35,383
Too many eyes are on Hye-jun now
for you to do

914
00:55:35,467 --> 00:55:36,843
both his and Hae-hyo's makeup.

915
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:39,221
Of course.

916
00:55:39,304 --> 00:55:41,389
I was going to call you to set things up,

917
00:55:41,932 --> 00:55:44,476
but you had Hae-hyo to care for too,

918
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:45,602
so I didn't.

919
00:55:45,685 --> 00:55:46,978
I thought I'd tell you today.

920
00:55:47,729 --> 00:55:48,688
Good thinking.

921
00:55:49,648 --> 00:55:52,108
He has countless events
and people to meet.

922
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:54,819
On top of that, being in this TV series

923
00:55:55,403 --> 00:55:57,239
requires a makeup artist on standby.

924
00:55:57,322 --> 00:55:58,782
It's why I had her promoted.

925
00:55:59,407 --> 00:56:01,326
You'll be best as an observer right now.

926
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:03,370
Got it.

927
00:56:05,247 --> 00:56:07,457
Managing his schedule
sure is tough enough.

928
00:56:10,085 --> 00:56:11,503
REPORTER KIM SU-MAN

929
00:56:12,504 --> 00:56:14,005
It's the reporter.

930
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:15,382
Just a second.

931
00:56:18,718 --> 00:56:20,720
-Yes, Ms. Kim.
-Ms. Lee.

932
00:56:20,804 --> 00:56:22,722
Mr. Sa's dating his makeup artist, right?

933
00:56:25,976 --> 00:56:28,395
What are you talking about? No way.

934
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,605
Haven't you done enough damage?

935
00:56:31,189 --> 00:56:32,983
First the article on Charlie Jung,

936
00:56:33,066 --> 00:56:35,402
and then his ex-girlfriend's interview.

937
00:56:35,485 --> 00:56:37,779
Why can't you leave him alone?

938
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:40,282
Once again,
you're barking up the wrong tree.

939
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:42,617
So I'm wrong?

940
00:56:43,952 --> 00:56:47,497
Spread wrongful rumors again
and I'll take action.

941
00:56:47,581 --> 00:56:49,624
Don't you dare write this article.

942
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:51,418
You do your job

943
00:56:52,502 --> 00:56:53,795
and I'll do mine.

944
00:56:59,593 --> 00:57:00,510
What's going on?

945
00:57:01,887 --> 00:57:03,013
What do we do?

946
00:57:03,555 --> 00:57:05,390
She's going to expose your relationship.

947
00:57:06,308 --> 00:57:08,059
This is bad for Hye-jun.

948
00:57:08,143 --> 00:57:10,061
His image will take a huge blow.

949
00:57:10,145 --> 00:57:12,772
First his ex, now his current girlfriend?

950
00:57:13,523 --> 00:57:15,859
This is bad. It's a terrible sign.

951
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:18,695
I'm going to sue her ass if she does it!

952
00:57:44,804 --> 00:57:46,181
It's nice to work together.

953
00:57:46,681 --> 00:57:47,849
-Right, Jeong-ha?
-Yes.

954
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:50,310
Just don't use me as a cover.

955
00:57:50,936 --> 00:57:52,145
Can't you let us?

956
00:57:53,063 --> 00:57:54,105
Okay, fine.

957
00:57:54,689 --> 00:57:57,067
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

958
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:59,736
It'll only be believable
if she's by my side.

959
00:58:00,403 --> 00:58:01,613
Is that so?

960
00:58:03,448 --> 00:58:04,366
Yes, it is.

961
00:58:04,449 --> 00:58:07,118
Besides, her standing with me
doesn't make her mine.

962
00:58:08,036 --> 00:58:10,121
You two always claim ownership over things

963
00:58:10,205 --> 00:58:11,414
that aren't even yours.

964
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,963
It's Seo-u. Take it.

965
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,717
-Hey.
-Hi, brothers.

966
00:58:23,218 --> 00:58:25,637
It's too bad we don't
have any scenes together.

967
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,013
Are you filming today?

968
00:58:27,097 --> 00:58:28,640
No, I'm here to practice.

969
00:58:28,723 --> 00:58:31,101
Isn't it weird to be romantic with him?

970
00:58:31,184 --> 00:58:34,771
Why would it be
when we're dating? Didn't you know that?

971
00:58:34,854 --> 00:58:37,482
-Hey.
-<i>What's with the sour-face?</i>

972
00:58:37,565 --> 00:58:41,236
<i>That's just how I'll be thinking
while filming this series.</i>

973
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,405
I can't afford this one to tank.

974
00:58:43,989 --> 00:58:46,032
-We should grab a bite sometime.
-<i>Sure.</i>

975
00:58:46,116 --> 00:58:48,910
Bye, Hae-hyo. Be nice to my boyfriend.

976
00:58:48,994 --> 00:58:49,911
<i>Bye!</i>

977
00:58:52,205 --> 00:58:53,456
What's with her?

978
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:56,167
She's being true to her character.

979
00:58:56,835 --> 00:58:58,128
The show should be a hit.

980
00:59:00,755 --> 00:59:02,465
We film the next scene in five.

981
00:59:02,549 --> 00:59:04,092
-Sure.
-Got it.

982
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:17,147
Can you take a photo of us?

983
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,982
-Why?
-To savor the moment.

984
00:59:38,501 --> 00:59:41,671
Don't you have a job out of town tomorrow?
Let me drive you there.

985
00:59:41,755 --> 00:59:43,590
It's okay. I can take the bus.

986
00:59:46,259 --> 00:59:47,927
Hye-jun's busy tomorrow morning,

987
00:59:48,762 --> 00:59:50,847
and he'll head abroad
for a fan meet-up event.

988
00:59:52,057 --> 00:59:54,142
-I didn't ask.
-I'm just saying.

989
01:00:02,025 --> 01:00:04,736
ALARM 5:00 A.M.

990
01:00:50,949 --> 01:00:52,992
HYE-JUN

991
01:00:54,619 --> 01:00:58,206
<i>You, who I have by my side,
are always the best.</i>

992
01:01:01,918 --> 01:01:04,003
<i>"Out of sight, out of mind."</i>

993
01:01:05,213 --> 01:01:07,757
<i>Not being within eyesight
makes someone grow distant.</i>

994
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,010
<i>I had faith
that our relationship was solid.</i>

995
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:13,596
<i>But faith</i>

996
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,932
<i>is much more fragile than love.</i>

997
01:01:20,687 --> 01:01:22,730
-Hi.
-Over here.

998
01:01:27,735 --> 01:01:30,196
-Are you the assistant director?
-Yes, I am.

999
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,448
I'm here as Kim Song-yeon's makeup team.

1000
01:01:32,532 --> 01:01:34,742
-You're Su-cheol's friend, right?
-Yes.

1001
01:01:34,826 --> 01:01:36,161
She's in that van.

1002
01:01:36,244 --> 01:01:37,620
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

1003
01:01:39,998 --> 01:01:42,041
That wasn't what happened.

1004
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:45,003
Come on. Let's start over.

1005
01:02:02,687 --> 01:02:04,230
Unbelievable.

1006
01:02:04,981 --> 01:02:06,816
It's almost midnight, damn it.

1007
01:02:08,067 --> 01:02:10,778
Could you lift your chin a bit?

1008
01:02:11,362 --> 01:02:14,782
Sure. Why can't they just be done with it?

1009
01:02:18,036 --> 01:02:20,955
I'm really sorry to ask,
but can you face straight ahead?

1010
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,626
Don't try to be perfect
and be a little less dense.

1011
01:02:26,419 --> 01:02:30,089
The makeup around your lips,
nose, and cheeks have gotten flaky.

1012
01:02:32,008 --> 01:02:33,593
Are you patronizing me?

1013
01:02:33,676 --> 01:02:36,888
It may not seem like a big deal,
but it'll show on the screen.

1014
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:39,641
Fine, just make it quick.

1015
01:02:41,309 --> 01:02:42,435
Are you done?

1016
01:02:48,191 --> 01:02:49,692
Be careful what you wish for.

1017
01:02:51,319 --> 01:02:53,363
So much for Mr. Workaholic.

1018
01:02:53,988 --> 01:02:55,531
Wake me up at the airport.

1019
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:58,034
We're here.

1020
01:03:22,934 --> 01:03:24,352
<i>But why do you hate rainy days?</i>

1021
01:03:25,186 --> 01:03:27,188
<i>It makes me feel like I'm all alone.</i>

1022
01:03:27,981 --> 01:03:29,941
<i>I'll call you when it rains.</i>

1023
01:03:30,817 --> 01:03:32,193
<i>You're not alone.</i>

1024
01:03:43,788 --> 01:03:46,499
HYE-JUN

1025
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,635
CALLING

1026
01:06:09,976 --> 01:06:10,935
You can come in.

1027
01:06:59,435 --> 01:07:06,716
Subtitle translation by: Hye-lim Park

1028
01:07:30,335 --> 01:07:33,272
RECORD OF YOUTH

1029
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:36,479
<i>She has an interview with Hae-ji
for a makeup job today.</i>

1030
01:07:36,562 --> 01:07:38,064
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

1031
01:07:38,147 --> 01:07:40,066
Now we have scandals round-the-clock.

1032
01:07:40,149 --> 01:07:41,526
<i>What do you think people want to know?</i>

1033
01:07:41,609 --> 01:07:45,404
-It's who he used to date.
-He seemed to be really competent.

1034
01:07:45,488 --> 01:07:47,365
Stay away from my family.

1035
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:50,576
Did you know that you can pay
to increase the number of followers?

1036
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,495
I wanted to prove
that I could make it on my own.

1037
01:07:52,578 --> 01:07:54,372
That's the one thing I asked you
to let me have!

1038
01:07:54,455 --> 01:07:55,289
What's this?

1039
01:07:55,373 --> 01:07:57,708
I want to make it up to you
for having been a lousy father.

1040
01:07:57,792 --> 01:08:00,002
