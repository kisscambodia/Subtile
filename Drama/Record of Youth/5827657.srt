2
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:49,943
Tie it off, come on!

3
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:16,594
Hey, guys!
Guys, I think we should turn back.

4
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:18,888
And lose good money?
Not a chance.

5
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:20,598
Stay close.

6
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,691
Here we are.

7
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,318
Get on his back.

8
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,047
Hurry up.

9
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:06,978
There he is. Go get him.

10
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:08,605
You'll pay for that.

11
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:07,914
No. No, please.

12
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,999
Please, no.

13
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:34,107
Hold it there.

14
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,251
I only got one...

15
00:03:53,418 --> 00:03:55,253
but he's a fine specimen.

16
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:03,511
-That's all?
-Yeah.

17
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:05,388
That shroom bit me twice.

18
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:15,273
Tomb Bloom.

19
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,089
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

20
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:43,343
<i>or perhaps twice upon a time,
for you may remember this story...</i>

21
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,889
<i>there was a powerful Fey
named Maleficent.</i>

22
00:04:57,023 --> 00:05:00,819
<i>For some reason, the mistress of evil
and protector of the Moors...</i>

23
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:03,988
<i>was still hated after all this time.</i>

24
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:06,991
<i>True, she had cursed the princess,
Aurora...</i>

25
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:10,995
<i>but that was before she found light
in the heart of a human child...</i>

26
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,915
<i>and raised the girl as her own.</i>

27
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:19,838
<i>After all, it was Maleficent's love
which broke that very same curse.</i>

28
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:24,175
<i>But that detail was somehow
mysteriously forgotten.</i>

29
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:29,722
<i>For as the tale was told
over and again throughout the kingdom...</i>

30
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,893
<i>Maleficent became the villain once more.</i>

31
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:48,616
It's time, guys.
Come on. Let's get everyone.

32
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:50,869
-It's the big day! Let's go!
-Come on.

33
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,620
Wake up. Wake up.

34
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:55,206
Come on.

35
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:09,387
Hurry up, wallerbogs! It's time!

36
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:25,904
Do you both remember the secret plan?

37
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:29,282
I've got it all right here.
When do I tell the queen the secret?

38
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,034
You must be patient, Thistlewit.

39
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:32,869
Do you think Queen Aurora's awake yet?

40
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:36,206
Well, she's not "Sleeping Beauty" anymore.

41
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:38,833
I see what you did there.

42
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:53,890
Next item of business, the missing fairies.

43
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,727
I've sent more sprites
to search the Tomb Bloom field.

44
00:06:57,894 --> 00:06:59,312
They'll report back to me at nightfall.

45
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,731
We will keep searching until we find them.

46
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,861
Please don't raise your roots at me, Lief.

47
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:10,198
Crushing humans with branches
is not going to help.

48
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:14,452
Diaval, you're supposed to be on my side.

49
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:20,375
Well, I'm Queen of the Moors,
and I am a human.

50
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:25,880
We must all learn a little kindness.

51
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:27,590
Coming through.

52
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:29,134
Excuse us.

53
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,343
Official pixie business.

54
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,636
A word, Your Majesty.

55
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:33,179
-Maybe two.
-Aunties...

56
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:35,473
you need to wait your turn
like everyone else.

57
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,517
-No!
-This can't wait, Your Grace.

58
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:38,935
Not for a moment.

59
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:41,521
Or I might burst.
Truly, I might.

60
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:43,356
Is that...?

61
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:47,694
Pinto!

62
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:52,407
She's come bearing gifts.
The first sap from the warming trees.

63
00:07:52,574 --> 00:07:53,700
It's for the big day!

64
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:55,660
Quiet, Thistlewit.

65
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,370
What big day?

66
00:07:59,748 --> 00:08:01,499
Hey! My crown!

67
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:08,798
I'm not in the mood for this.

68
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,551
Pinto!

69
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:22,979
Come on.

70
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:25,482
Where are you going, aunties?

71
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,154
I don't have time for games, Pinto.

72
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:51,091
What's gotten into all of you?

73
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,350
There she goes, Your Majesty.

74
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,271
Come back here.

75
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:14,823
Pinto. I've had enough
of your games for today.

76
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:16,783
Look at me.

77
00:09:24,374 --> 00:09:26,167
Philip. What are you doing here?

78
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:27,585
I was looking for you.

79
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,712
-Well, hello.
-Hello.

80
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,006
I'm really sorry, 
I can't talk right now.

81
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:34,926
The Moors have turned to madness.
I've got a castle full of complaints.

82
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:36,261
I know how busy you are.

83
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:39,055
-I wanted to ask you something.
-Yes.

84
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:42,684
Do you think there could be a union
between Ulstead and the Moors?

85
00:09:43,685 --> 00:09:45,061
A union?

86
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:46,980
To connect both lands.

87
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:49,274
To bring harmony and peace.

88
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:51,484
I've been imagining a bridge.

89
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,403
A bridge.

90
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:55,238
Yes, a bridge.

91
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:57,615
A union's a wonderful idea...

92
00:09:57,782 --> 00:09:59,659
if both sides are willing.

93
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,663
Well, I'm working on that part.

94
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,248
He's going to blow it.

95
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:06,499
Give him time. 
He's warming up.

96
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:10,628
Wait.

97
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:14,007
That's your formal coat.

98
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:17,927
You're in on all of this, aren't you?

99
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:20,263
If you're busy, 
I could always come back.

100
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,140
No. No, no.

101
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:23,516
I'm not busy at all.

102
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:24,976
No, because I'd hate to...

103
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:27,771
Really. All ears.
What did you want to talk about?

104
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:30,982
You're right.
He's blowing it.

105
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:34,819
Five years ago,
I thought I lost you forever.

106
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:39,115
I've decided to reclaim this day for us.

107
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:42,786
I've loved you since the moment I met you
and every day since.

108
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:46,539
If love has a truth, here is mine.

109
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:50,418
There is no magic nor curse that could
ever tear me away from you, Aurora.

110
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,925
-Are you sure this is a good time?
-Philip.

111
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:00,428
He's on his knee.

112
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:01,930
He took his sweet time about it.

113
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:04,766
Will you marry me?

114
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:07,977
Yes.

115
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:09,729
-Yes?
-Yes.

116
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:10,730
Yes!

117
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:13,066
Yes, just stand up. Kiss me.

118
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:24,953
We're having a wedding!

119
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:29,707
A secret surprise wedding.

120
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:35,213
Of course, we have to tell our parents.

121
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:39,300
Do we?

122
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:10,457
Mistress.

123
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:11,958
What?

124
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,252
I have a little bit of news.

125
00:12:14,794 --> 00:12:16,546
Well, on with it.

126
00:12:17,547 --> 00:12:19,340
It's nothing of any real consequence...

127
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:23,178
and it's certainly no reason to overreact.

128
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:25,138
It's just that...

129
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,766
Prince Philip has...

130
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:29,601
Disappeared?

131
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:32,771
No. No. Philip has...

132
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:34,355
Yellow fever? No, wait!

133
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:36,941
Leprosy!

134
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:38,735
No, Mistress.

135
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:42,363
Prince Philip has asked Aurora
if she'll become his...

136
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,199
Don't...

137
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:47,327
ruin my morning.

138
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:51,206
Mistress, please.

139
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,127
Stay calm!

140
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:04,928
<i>So, tell me, sire...</i>

141
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:08,473
am I to be a best man,
or did you choose a creature from the Moors?

142
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,143
General, if that's your way of asking me
if she said yes, then I...

143
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,229
I know she said yes, sire.

144
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:16,898
What human wouldn't want to leave that place?

145
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:18,650
What do you have against Moor folk, Percival?

146
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:21,069
"Moor folk"?
Is that what we're calling them now?

147
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:23,446
Winged beasts, murderous trees.

148
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:25,281
Guard your tongue, General.

149
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:26,658
You know nothing about them.

150
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:28,618
I know that Maleficent
is a killer of men...

151
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:32,288
destroyer of armies.
Or so the story goes.

152
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:34,999
She's not like that.

153
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,502
It's my job to protect this kingdom.

154
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:39,254
And I will do so, old friend...

155
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:41,756
without hesitation.

156
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:44,050
Walk on.

157
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:50,640
Open the gates!

158
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:03,778
Your Majesty, spoils from the annexation
of the Midlands have arrived.

159
00:14:04,654 --> 00:14:05,655
Weapons.

160
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:09,743
No. We have no need of arms.

161
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:12,579
Our days of war are over.

162
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:17,417
Ingrith...

163
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:21,296
you see where I've had you placed.
Right behind me.

164
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:25,008
And that's where I'll always be.

165
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,470
Ingrith, I said we
had no need of arms.

166
00:14:29,012 --> 00:14:31,306
One can never be too careful.

167
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:39,189
Your Majesty, it's cocked.

168
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,316
Is it, now?

169
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:48,406
-Father, Mother.
-Well?

170
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:49,866
What did she say?

171
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:51,284
She said yes.

172
00:14:51,576 --> 00:14:52,577
Yes!

173
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:56,164
That is wonderful news.

174
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:58,958
Two kingdoms united at last.

175
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:00,043
Yes.

176
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,714
Yes.

177
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:07,467
Perhaps I've been selfish...

178
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:09,928
looking at this the wrong way.

179
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:13,139
You've made your choice.

180
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:14,933
Now is a time to celebrate.

181
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:21,731
I'm glad you finally approve.

182
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:23,066
Much more than that.

183
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:27,362
I am ready to welcome your fiancĂ©e
with open arms.

184
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:30,615
She shall come to dinner.

185
00:15:30,782 --> 00:15:31,825
That would be incredible.

186
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:33,576
Under one condition.

187
00:15:33,743 --> 00:15:35,120
She will bring her godmother.

188
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:36,788
Your Majesty, I strongly...

189
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:40,750
We will meet the one who raised her
right here in this castle.

190
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:42,168
Yes. The queen is right.

191
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,420
I'm not sure her godmother will...

192
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:45,130
No, but I insist.

193
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:49,384
After all, we will soon be family.

194
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:51,928
Well, let it be known
throughout the kingdom...

195
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:56,099
that my son is to marry Aurora.

196
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,602
And Maleficent is coming to dinner.

197
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,898
I shall send word straightaway.

198
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:27,255
Incoming.

199
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,802
Hold on to your petticoats!

200
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:45,940
Well, well.

201
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:49,944
So?

202
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:52,113
So.

203
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:56,868
Godmother...

204
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:02,832
Philip asked me to marry him.

205
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:05,335
Poor thing.

206
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,170
He'll recover.

207
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:11,216
My answer was yes.

208
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:15,053
No.

209
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:16,262
Yes.

210
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:17,388
No.

211
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:18,765
I wasn't really asking.

212
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:20,016
Nor was I.

213
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:22,060
What's next?

214
00:17:22,227 --> 00:17:23,895
You'll turn him into a goat?

215
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:27,649
Stop.

216
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:30,318
Why don't you like Philip?

217
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:32,320
Well, for one thing, he's human.

218
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:33,905
I'm a human.

219
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:36,950
And I have never held that against you.

220
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:39,285
Until I fell in love.

221
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:43,581
Love doesn't always end well, Beasty.

222
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,252
I'll have you know
Prince Philip is a prince.

223
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:50,046
A very handsome and charming prince.

224
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:56,636
I'm just asking you to trust me.

225
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:58,930
Please give him a chance.

226
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:00,765
Let us prove you wrong.

227
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:02,851
Philip is thoughtful...

228
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:04,394
he's very kind...

229
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:05,854
Kind of what?

230
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:08,815
The king and queen are celebrating tonight...

231
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:11,443
and they have invited both of us
to the castle.

232
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:16,781
You want me to meet his parents?

233
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:18,450
It's just a dinner.

234
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:22,328
They don't want me in Ulstead.

235
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:24,289
Why on earth would I go?

236
00:18:24,748 --> 00:18:27,542
Because his mother wishes to meet mine.

237
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:30,545
Please.

238
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:40,180
Philip.

239
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,432
I want you to wear this tonight.

240
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:45,060
Your sword?

241
00:18:45,226 --> 00:18:48,855
Because of you,
Ulstead and the Moors will be united at last.

242
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:55,570
Father, my love for Aurora
has nothing to do with politics.

243
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:57,989
Yes, but your love...

244
00:18:58,156 --> 00:19:01,910
will ensure peace for generations.

245
00:19:02,077 --> 00:19:04,412
Now take it. And wear it...

246
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:07,540
to know that you will
never have to use it.

247
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,668
My son.

248
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:14,506
I've never been more proud.

249
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:18,551
And what about Mother?

250
00:19:18,718 --> 00:19:20,845
Is she okay with this?

251
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:25,850
Your mother will learn
to love who you love.

252
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,160
Tomb Bloom.
Tomb Bloom.

253
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:43,595
I'm losing my patience.

254
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,346
Your Majesty.

255
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,266
You need to move faster, Lickspittle.

256
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:49,476
Yes, Your Majesty.

257
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,438
Aurora said yes.

258
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,612
It's all coming together...

259
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:04,324
perfectly.

260
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,168
Hello.

261
00:21:16,294 --> 00:21:17,879
Hello.

262
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:21,466
Hello.

263
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:25,386
Try it with a little less fang.

264
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:29,516
How's this?

265
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:33,186
Try the greeting.

266
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:37,690
How kind of you
to invite me this evening.

267
00:21:37,857 --> 00:21:39,734
Remember, it's not a threat.

268
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:44,697
So very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

269
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:47,659
Yeah. Better.

270
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:49,702
Try it with a curtsy.

271
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:53,623
We can skip that part.

272
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,463
She really loves that boy, you know.

273
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:04,134
You're doing her a great kindness.

274
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:07,804
Kindness?

275
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,931
Mistress...

276
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,572
Doesn't she look lovely?

277
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:31,619
I have something for you.

278
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:36,541
For your horns.

279
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,754
I just thought it might make Philip's family
feel more comfortable.

280
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:42,464
And you, as well.

281
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,011
Maybe it's a bad idea.

282
00:22:48,344 --> 00:22:49,888
No, it's...

283
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:52,891
It's all right.

284
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:03,693
I'm so excited.

285
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:07,113
It's more than I can bear.

286
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,735
It's Maleficent!

287
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:53,284
Pitchforks?

288
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:55,203
Humans are hilarious.

289
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,793
It's getting better.

290
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:20,770
-Anyone leaves their post gets hung.
-Yes, sir.

291
00:24:30,697 --> 00:24:32,407
They're here.

292
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,750
Have you ever considered
turning me into a bear?

293
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:44,127
I think I'd make quite an impressive one.

294
00:24:44,294 --> 00:24:45,545
Look at their claws.
They're so strong.

295
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:47,505
Why are we talking about bears?

296
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:51,092
Presenting Queen Aurora of the Moors.

297
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:02,437
Thank you.

298
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:07,233
-You look wonderful.
-I'm so happy to be here.

299
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:11,696
Aurora, this is truly an honor.

300
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:17,619
Welcome to Ulstead.

301
00:25:20,163 --> 00:25:21,623
Such a beautiful girl.

302
00:25:22,332 --> 00:25:24,793
I can see how you stole Philip's heart.

303
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:28,254
Your Majesty.

304
00:25:31,257 --> 00:25:34,427
The flowers in your hair. I'm allergic.

305
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:36,012
I'm so sorry.

306
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,516
Oh, no. No, no. It's all right.
They're beautiful.

307
00:25:39,682 --> 00:25:40,850
Presenting Maleficent.

308
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:55,156
Maleficent, it's wonderful to see you again.

309
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:59,619
This is my father, 
King John of Ulstead.

310
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:01,663
And my mother, 
Queen Ingrith.

311
00:26:02,455 --> 00:26:05,166
Welcome to our home.

312
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,674
It's so very kind of you to invite me
this evening.

313
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:14,467
Don't smile.

314
00:26:16,803 --> 00:26:19,764
And I would like
to introduce you to Diaval.

315
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:24,561
I trust you had no trouble
finding the castle.

316
00:26:24,728 --> 00:26:26,396
Why would I have trouble?

317
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:32,318
He's making small talk.

318
00:26:32,652 --> 00:26:34,654
I'll explain it later.

319
00:26:35,238 --> 00:26:36,656
No trouble at all.

320
00:26:36,823 --> 00:26:40,034
Your Majesties, ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

321
00:26:40,577 --> 00:26:43,705
Please, make yourselves at home.

322
00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:14,027
Bird.

323
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:17,655
Delicious.

324
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:27,791
Is there a problem?

325
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:31,086
It's iron.

326
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:35,381
Majesty, as you are sensitive to flowers,
she is averse to iron.

327
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,760
I had no idea.

328
00:27:38,927 --> 00:27:41,387
Take it away at once.

329
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:49,604
I trust you'll be comfortable
using your hands?

330
00:27:51,898 --> 00:27:53,900
Such a warm spell of weather, isn't it?

331
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,527
It certainly is.

332
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:03,034
Well, we have a small gift
for Philip and Aurora...

333
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:06,871
to celebrate their
glorious future together.

334
00:28:17,382 --> 00:28:19,843
I simply can't wait to have a little one
running through the castle again.

335
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:26,141
This castle?

336
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:27,684
Yes, of course.

337
00:28:30,437 --> 00:28:32,021
This will be their home.

338
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,067
I hear Aurora has
a castle of her own.

339
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,903
Yes, sir, I do.

340
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,447
Yes...

341
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:46,244
I'm curious. How did Aurora
become Queen of the Moors?

342
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:47,579
I made her queen.

343
00:28:47,746 --> 00:28:49,664
Her castle is quite stunning.
You must see it.

344
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:52,751
Yes, but in fact, she has another castle.

345
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:55,378
Does she not?

346
00:28:56,796 --> 00:28:57,714
Mother...

347
00:28:57,881 --> 00:29:01,801
One in the Moors,
and one left behind by her father.

348
00:29:01,968 --> 00:29:04,971
King Stefan, was it not?

349
00:29:05,722 --> 00:29:08,850
That castle was never my home.
It was given to the people.

350
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:12,645
So, you're also a true princess.

351
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:14,898
Even though Stefan died.
Was killed?

352
00:29:15,065 --> 00:29:16,858
Remind me, did he
die or was he killed?

353
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,986
Both.

354
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,948
Yes, you're right, it is very warm recently.

355
00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:27,952
Because I remember
the story of a baby.

356
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:31,164
A baby cursed to sleep...

357
00:29:32,123 --> 00:29:33,416
and never wake up.

358
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:36,002
Really?

359
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:39,756
Who would do such a terrible thing
to an innocent child?

360
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:46,096
Well, there are many who prey
on the innocent.

361
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:48,348
I'm sure your kind would agree.

362
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,183
What do you mean, my kind?

363
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,811
She means humans.

364
00:29:52,977 --> 00:29:54,813
There are fairies missing from the Moors.

365
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:56,523
What I'm missing is some wine.

366
00:29:56,689 --> 00:29:58,400
Stolen by human poachers.

367
00:29:58,566 --> 00:29:59,859
That's the first I've heard of it.

368
00:30:00,026 --> 00:30:01,361
Someone gave the order.

369
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:11,413
It sounds as if you're accusing the king.

370
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:13,957
No, she never said that.

371
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:16,543
Wait...
Sorry, who would steal a fairy?

372
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:19,087
Your Majesty, I must report
that two peasants were found dead...

373
00:30:19,254 --> 00:30:21,047
just outside the Moors.

374
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:22,882
They'd been missing for several days.

375
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:24,050
I see.

376
00:30:24,717 --> 00:30:26,052
Yes, we all see.

377
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:30,557
The borders are open, but humans
are not welcome. Isn't that right?

378
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:33,977
What exactly are you implying, Your Majesty?

379
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:37,272
Innocent men are being slaughtered
on the Moors...

380
00:30:37,731 --> 00:30:39,441
and she's talking about fairies.

381
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,780
Contain your animal.

382
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:47,741
Or I will.

383
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:54,998
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were making a threat.

384
00:30:55,165 --> 00:30:56,207
Well, do you?

385
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:57,208
Do I what?

386
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,334
Know better?

387
00:30:58,501 --> 00:30:59,502
Enough.

388
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:00,920
Put her down.

389
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,340
Please, put her down.

390
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,471
We're here to celebrate.

391
00:31:12,474 --> 00:31:14,559
Forgive me, he's right.

392
00:31:14,726 --> 00:31:16,686
Let's not forget why we're here.

393
00:31:16,853 --> 00:31:19,773
The start of a new life for Aurora.

394
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:23,276
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

395
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:31,076
You have done an admirable job, Maleficent...

396
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:35,288
going against your own nature
to raise this child.

397
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:37,749
But now...

398
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:41,336
Aurora will finally get...

399
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:43,838
the love of a real family.

400
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:46,049
A real mother.

401
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:49,511
Because the one thing I regret...

402
00:31:49,677 --> 00:31:52,347
is never having a daughter of my own.

403
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:55,350
But tonight changes that.

404
00:31:55,517 --> 00:32:00,939
Tonight, I consider Aurora my own.

405
00:32:15,328 --> 00:32:16,371
Guards!

406
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:18,581
We have opened our home to a witch!

407
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:30,218
Stop!

408
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:32,679
There is no union.

409
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:34,305
There will be no wedding.

410
00:32:34,472 --> 00:32:37,142
-Maleficent!
-We must protect the king!

411
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:38,935
Maleficent, please, stop now.

412
00:32:39,102 --> 00:32:41,438
John, I'm so frightened.

413
00:32:43,022 --> 00:32:45,066
What has she done to me?

414
00:32:46,526 --> 00:32:47,527
Father!

415
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:50,530
John!

416
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,490
We go home.

417
00:32:54,534 --> 00:32:55,326
John!

418
00:32:56,536 --> 00:32:57,537
It's a curse.

419
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:01,416
It's a curse!

420
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,793
Maleficent has cursed the king!

421
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:07,672
What have you done?

422
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,632
I've done nothing.

423
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:12,927
Aurora, we go home now.

424
00:33:15,013 --> 00:33:16,014
Aurora!

425
00:33:29,861 --> 00:33:30,945
Aurora!

426
00:33:31,237 --> 00:33:32,655
Wake him!

427
00:33:34,908 --> 00:33:36,701
Wake him, please.

428
00:35:00,076 --> 00:35:01,453
Stand aside!

429
00:35:03,747 --> 00:35:04,998
To the bedroom!

430
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:09,377
This magic, we have
no tools to reverse it.

431
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:14,090
There must be a lesion.

432
00:35:14,257 --> 00:35:15,508
Proof of her witchery.

433
00:35:15,675 --> 00:35:17,844
Please, leave His Majesty his dignity.

434
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:20,972
We all saw what Maleficent did to him.

435
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,308
I'm so sorry.

436
00:35:23,475 --> 00:35:26,895
A curse upon our king
is a curse upon this kingdom.

437
00:35:28,438 --> 00:35:31,024
All he wanted was peace.

438
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:33,026
This is all my fault.

439
00:35:33,693 --> 00:35:35,945
You have nothing to apologize for, my dear.

440
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:40,492
Maleficent is a threat to everyone.

441
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,744
Especially you.

442
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:46,206
We'll do our best to protect you.

443
00:35:47,332 --> 00:35:49,459
There must be a way to reverse this.

444
00:35:51,252 --> 00:35:53,630
Mother, could you try kissing him?

445
00:35:55,673 --> 00:35:57,717
True love and all that.

446
00:36:02,055 --> 00:36:03,765
I doubt that would work.

447
00:36:03,932 --> 00:36:05,183
It could save him.

448
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,977
-A kiss is just a kiss.
-Please, Mother.

449
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:09,771
Very well.

450
00:36:20,448 --> 00:36:22,409
You wanted peace...

451
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:25,912
now rest in peace forever.

452
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:36,756
I told you.

453
00:36:36,923 --> 00:36:39,884
This is no fairy tale.

454
00:36:40,468 --> 00:36:42,595
I have to return to the Moors.

455
00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:43,805
It's the only way.

456
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:45,181
Wait, wait. Come here.

457
00:36:45,348 --> 00:36:46,808
I have to find her.

458
00:36:46,975 --> 00:36:47,976
It's the middle of the night.

459
00:36:48,143 --> 00:36:49,811
She will break the curse.
I know she will.

460
00:36:49,978 --> 00:36:51,604
Okay, well,
let me come with you.

461
00:36:52,063 --> 00:36:54,190
No. You should stay with your family.

462
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:55,692
You are my family.

463
00:36:57,736 --> 00:36:59,696
Let her go, Philip.

464
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:02,157
Maybe she can save him.

465
00:37:58,046 --> 00:37:59,756
Maleficent!

466
00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:05,053
Maleficent!

467
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,270
Godmother!

468
00:38:21,152 --> 00:38:23,446
Please come back.

469
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,701
She's not in the Moors.

470
00:38:30,161 --> 00:38:31,162
Diaval.

471
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:34,332
No one's seen her.

472
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,167
I'm so happy to see you.

473
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:39,337
She's nowhere to be found.

474
00:38:40,797 --> 00:38:42,549
What if she never comes back?

475
00:38:42,715 --> 00:38:44,884
I could be stuck as a human forever.

476
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:46,678
I have to find her.

477
00:38:49,764 --> 00:38:52,517
She's the only one
who can break the curse.

478
00:39:52,577 --> 00:39:53,953
Tell me she's dead.

479
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:57,290
The iron pierced her flesh.

480
00:39:57,457 --> 00:40:00,043
She fell into the river
and went over the falls.

481
00:40:01,544 --> 00:40:04,297
Then where is her head?

482
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:06,758
There was something else.

483
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:08,968
Another creature.

484
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:12,263
It pulled her from
the depths of the sea.

485
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:14,474
What did it look like?

486
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,059
Her.

487
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:19,854
It carried her up into the sky.

488
00:40:20,313 --> 00:40:23,733
A wounded animal lashes out
and now she's not alone.

489
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,528
We must be ready for war.

490
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:31,324
Maleficent has cursed the king!

491
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:39,082
Stay inside!

492
00:40:46,423 --> 00:40:47,966
Maleficent has cursed the king!

493
00:42:21,017 --> 00:42:24,813
If Conall hadn't found her,
she would be dead.

494
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:30,485
They tried to kill her with this.

495
00:42:47,293 --> 00:42:49,254
Do you hear it?

496
00:42:50,588 --> 00:42:51,631
Do you hear it?

497
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,095
It's a message from the humans.

498
00:42:58,638 --> 00:43:00,390
I hear it loud and clear.

499
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:03,351
Time for us to die.

500
00:43:04,477 --> 00:43:08,064
Humans have used iron
against us for centuries.

501
00:43:08,231 --> 00:43:10,608
And we are almost extinct because of it.

502
00:43:10,775 --> 00:43:14,487
Killing peasants on the Moors
will only lead to more conflict, Borra.

503
00:43:15,155 --> 00:43:16,656
They've pulled the iron from the earth...

504
00:43:16,823 --> 00:43:19,492
made their swords and shields,
drove us underground.

505
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:20,994
But this...

506
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:25,415
This will finish us.

507
00:43:25,582 --> 00:43:27,125
Our people are safe here for now.

508
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:29,043
But for how long?

509
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,087
The humans will find us.
They will not stop.

510
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,882
I call for war.

511
00:43:35,508 --> 00:43:37,051
I call for war!

512
00:43:37,218 --> 00:43:38,261
Right now!

513
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:41,598
There are too many humans.

514
00:43:44,184 --> 00:43:45,185
Too many kingdoms.

515
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:49,272
Conall, they will keep finding
new ways to destroy us.

516
00:43:49,439 --> 00:43:51,024
We can't win.

517
00:43:55,195 --> 00:43:57,363
We can't win!

518
00:44:00,075 --> 00:44:01,076
Not this way.

519
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:04,621
No. You're wrong, Conall.

520
00:44:06,498 --> 00:44:08,917
We have something they didn't plan on.

521
00:44:11,336 --> 00:44:13,171
We have her.

522
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:20,178
She holds powers none of us possess.

523
00:44:22,472 --> 00:44:23,890
She is wounded, Borra.

524
00:44:25,308 --> 00:44:26,643
Who are you?

525
00:44:43,243 --> 00:44:45,412
You reek of human.

526
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:48,957
Maybe I was wrong about you.

527
00:44:49,457 --> 00:44:52,961
Or maybe Conall should have left you
for dead at the bottom of the sea.

528
00:44:56,923 --> 00:44:58,133
No.

529
00:44:59,634 --> 00:45:01,678
It's there, isn't it?

530
00:45:03,263 --> 00:45:04,514
It's inside you.

531
00:45:23,575 --> 00:45:24,659
You see?

532
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:31,082
You see what's inside her?

533
00:45:32,876 --> 00:45:34,544
That is what will save us all.

534
00:45:52,687 --> 00:45:54,189
You saved me.

535
00:45:57,859 --> 00:45:59,110
Come.

536
00:46:03,865 --> 00:46:06,159
Let me show you who we are.

537
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:03,299
We're Dark Fey.

538
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:06,386
Same as you.

539
00:47:18,148 --> 00:47:19,357
We're all that remain.

540
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:23,695
Unseen here, far away from mankind.

541
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,113
Look!

542
00:47:26,656 --> 00:47:29,242
As more human kingdoms emerged,
we went into hiding...

543
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:32,036
from every corner of the earth...

544
00:47:32,412 --> 00:47:35,206
doing what we had to, to survive.

545
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:38,293
But many were lost.

546
00:48:00,857 --> 00:48:03,234
Only a few generations ago...

547
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:05,653
our kind roamed every part of the world.

548
00:48:07,072 --> 00:48:08,323
The tundra.

549
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:09,783
The forest.

550
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:11,326
The jungle.

551
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:17,290
The desert.

552
00:48:22,921 --> 00:48:25,548
Now, our only refuge is here...

553
00:48:25,715 --> 00:48:27,300
in this cave.

554
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:29,511
Our nest of origin.

555
00:48:33,932 --> 00:48:36,476
Listen. Play in the wind.

556
00:48:38,228 --> 00:48:39,229
Go!

557
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:02,752
Those children should be soaring
over the trees and rivers.

558
00:49:02,919 --> 00:49:04,838
Instead, they are raised in exile.

559
00:49:05,463 --> 00:49:06,923
I could protect them.

560
00:49:08,758 --> 00:49:11,344
How? By waging war against the humans?

561
00:49:11,511 --> 00:49:13,430
I've been at war
with them my whole life.

562
00:49:13,596 --> 00:49:14,639
Not all of them.

563
00:49:15,598 --> 00:49:17,934
There was one you raised as your own.

564
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:23,273
Maybe we don't have
to hide from the humans.

565
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,358
Maybe we can exist without fear...

566
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:27,318
and war.

567
00:49:27,777 --> 00:49:30,155
Find a way together.

568
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:33,658
That will never happen.

569
00:51:05,792 --> 00:51:06,793
Gotcha!

570
00:51:11,297 --> 00:51:14,968
Welcome to your new home.

571
00:51:33,987 --> 00:51:36,406
We've been worried about you, dear.

572
00:51:37,449 --> 00:51:38,450
Your Majesty.

573
00:51:39,409 --> 00:51:41,286
I couldn't find her.

574
00:51:41,453 --> 00:51:44,080
My heart breaks for you.

575
00:51:45,123 --> 00:51:48,543
She has brought a cloud of darkness
upon your happiness.

576
00:51:49,669 --> 00:51:52,088
I know she was against this marriage.

577
00:51:52,672 --> 00:51:55,550
Never trusted your instincts as a queen.

578
00:51:56,092 --> 00:51:58,636
When I saw her at dinner...

579
00:51:59,971 --> 00:52:02,724
with her horns covered...

580
00:52:05,143 --> 00:52:06,853
bent cowering...

581
00:52:11,649 --> 00:52:15,236
Well, it's no wonder that she lashed out.

582
00:52:16,279 --> 00:52:17,781
I just don't know what to do.

583
00:52:18,406 --> 00:52:21,117
You do truly love him, don't you?

584
00:52:21,284 --> 00:52:22,702
My son.

585
00:52:23,203 --> 00:52:24,204
Deeply.

586
00:52:25,497 --> 00:52:28,124
It is love that will heal you.

587
00:52:28,917 --> 00:52:30,543
It's what heals us all.

588
00:52:31,336 --> 00:52:34,589
Let's move forward together...

589
00:52:35,423 --> 00:52:37,133
as a family.

590
00:52:53,608 --> 00:52:56,444
<i>To all who live on the Moors...</i>

591
00:52:58,488 --> 00:53:00,532
What is that noise?

592
00:53:00,698 --> 00:53:03,660
<i>...and kingdoms far and wide,
the king and queen invite you...</i>

593
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:05,870
<i>to attend the wedding...</i>

594
00:53:06,413 --> 00:53:09,374
<i>of their son Philip to Aurora
in three days' time.</i>

595
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:11,918
<i>All are welcome.</i>

596
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:17,507
<i>And all are expected!</i>

597
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,261
Did you hear that?
We're invited to the castle!

598
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:23,513
I knew Aurora wouldn't abandon us!

599
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,765
I always knew I'd be invited.

600
00:53:25,932 --> 00:53:28,059
Just glad you two made the cut.

601
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:30,645
Who's getting married?

602
00:53:38,862 --> 00:53:42,699
Aurora, we don't have to think
about the wedding right now.

603
00:53:44,117 --> 00:53:45,869
The queen is right.

604
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:48,371
We owe it to everyone...

605
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,040
especially the king.

606
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,877
What about Maleficent?

607
00:53:57,005 --> 00:53:59,132
She's gone.

608
00:54:11,895 --> 00:54:13,313
The Phoenix.

609
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,815
It is said the
Dark Fey began with her...

610
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:19,235
evolved over centuries.

611
00:54:21,029 --> 00:54:23,323
You are the last of her descendants.

612
00:54:24,115 --> 00:54:26,493
Her blood is your own.

613
00:54:28,161 --> 00:54:29,913
You are her.

614
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:36,628
In your hands,
you hold the power of life and death...

615
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:39,589
destruction and rebirth.

616
00:54:40,924 --> 00:54:46,596
But nature's greatest power
is the power of true transformation.

617
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:51,643
You transformed when you raised Aurora.

618
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,730
When you found love...

619
00:54:55,897 --> 00:54:58,983
in the middle of your pain.

620
00:55:00,693 --> 00:55:03,321
I'm asking you to
take all of your fury...

621
00:55:04,114 --> 00:55:05,782
all of your pain...

622
00:55:06,324 --> 00:55:08,785
and not use it.

623
00:55:08,952 --> 00:55:12,247
Help us broker peace with the humans.

624
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,166
Because peace...

625
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,505
could be the Dark Fey's
final transformation.

626
00:55:27,971 --> 00:55:31,141
The Moors are our
last true nature on earth.

627
00:55:32,142 --> 00:55:35,603
And yet you named a human as queen.

628
00:55:36,271 --> 00:55:38,898
A daughter you cared for.

629
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:43,153
I have no daughter.

630
00:55:45,822 --> 00:55:48,158
She has chosen her side.

631
00:56:00,545 --> 00:56:02,213
We've just heard.

632
00:56:02,756 --> 00:56:05,467
There's going to be a wedding
at the castle in three days.

633
00:56:07,093 --> 00:56:09,262
Humans will come from all over.

634
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:11,639
That's when we attack.

635
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:14,559
We'll kill the king and queen of Ulstead...

636
00:56:14,726 --> 00:56:16,728
and their young prince.

637
00:56:19,481 --> 00:56:21,608
Their kingdom will fall.

638
00:56:22,192 --> 00:56:24,778
And the Fey will rise again.

639
00:56:40,627 --> 00:56:43,254
The fairies made it.

640
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:01,815
I wore it when I married the king.

641
00:57:08,488 --> 00:57:11,408
I'm sure it's perfect.

642
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:13,368
So am I.

643
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:21,626
Your Majesty, she's absolutely lovely.

644
00:57:22,168 --> 00:57:23,753
Considering how she was raised.

645
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,297
By the same evil witch who cursed her.

646
00:57:26,881 --> 00:57:29,592
It's a miracle Prince Philip came along.

647
00:57:29,759 --> 00:57:32,720
It's a miracle
the poor child is alive at all.

648
00:57:34,013 --> 00:57:35,932
Thank you so much.

649
00:57:36,099 --> 00:57:37,100
It's exquisite.

650
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,257
<i>When I'm older...</i>

651
00:58:09,424 --> 00:58:11,217
I'm going to live here,
in the Moors, with you.

652
00:58:12,302 --> 00:58:14,721
Then we can look after each other.

653
00:58:36,034 --> 00:58:37,952
-Tell me what's troubling you.
-It's nothing.

654
00:58:39,162 --> 00:58:41,706
Aurora, I know you better than that.

655
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:45,752
This jewelry...

656
00:58:46,669 --> 00:58:48,004
my hair...

657
00:58:48,171 --> 00:58:50,256
all these rules.

658
00:58:51,466 --> 00:58:52,926
I can't breathe.

659
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:56,596
I feel like
I'm not Queen of the Moors anymore.

660
00:58:56,971 --> 00:58:58,973
I feel like a different person.

661
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:00,558
Listen...

662
00:59:01,184 --> 00:59:04,562
I fell in love with a girl in the forest
and only her.

663
00:59:04,729 --> 00:59:06,231
You don't have to change.

664
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:08,525
I don't want you to change.

665
00:59:16,783 --> 00:59:19,828
I should have never asked her
to wear that scarf.

666
00:59:39,055 --> 00:59:40,348
Ah, yes.

667
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:43,476
Well...

668
00:59:44,644 --> 00:59:46,438
Does it work?

669
00:59:46,604 --> 00:59:49,399
I only have a handful of fairy specimens
to work with...

670
00:59:49,566 --> 00:59:52,026
and the extraction process is painstaking.

671
00:59:52,986 --> 00:59:54,738
Extraction from what?

672
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:57,866
Tomb Bloom flowers.

673
00:59:58,032 --> 01:00:00,869
They grow from a fairy's grave,
contain their very essence.

674
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:02,871
When you mix the pollen
with iron powder...

675
01:00:03,037 --> 01:00:05,832
the resulting dust ends a fairy's life.

676
01:00:05,999 --> 01:00:07,625
We will need thousands more.

677
01:00:09,502 --> 01:00:10,795
Show me.

678
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:13,882
Show me.

679
01:00:14,466 --> 01:00:15,341
Very well.

680
01:00:18,636 --> 01:00:19,471
So...

681
01:01:09,729 --> 01:01:13,525
Finally, the Moors will be mine.

682
01:01:14,109 --> 01:01:17,028
No more fairies.

683
01:01:51,396 --> 01:01:52,522
Stay alert, men.

684
01:02:11,332 --> 01:02:12,375
This is where I found them.

685
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:13,543
Excellent.

686
01:02:14,127 --> 01:02:15,754
But what if the winged one returns?

687
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,839
Don't you worry about that.

688
01:02:18,757 --> 01:02:19,758
We'll be ready.

689
01:02:19,924 --> 01:02:21,092
Take the Tomb Blooms.

690
01:02:21,843 --> 01:02:23,762
Get to work!

691
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:40,528
Sentries, stay alert!

692
01:02:40,612 --> 01:02:41,946
Keep your weapons on hand.

693
01:03:02,509 --> 01:03:03,927
Move it!

694
01:03:11,893 --> 01:03:13,353
Maleficent...

695
01:03:56,354 --> 01:03:59,274
This is where we bury our dead.

696
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:02,444
They've destroyed it.

697
01:04:07,073 --> 01:04:09,075
This is what the humans do.

698
01:04:09,576 --> 01:04:11,828
They're nothing but locusts
that swarm the earth.

699
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:13,663
We have to stop them.

700
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:19,419
You spent years caring for a human...

701
01:04:19,586 --> 01:04:22,589
now it's time to care for your own.

702
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,183
Fire!

703
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:55,663
Reload! We go again!

704
01:05:01,628 --> 01:05:02,921
Fire!

705
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:09,010
Reload! There's another one!

706
01:06:26,045 --> 01:06:27,839
Everyone, stay together!

707
01:06:28,006 --> 01:06:29,674
We're about to leave the Moors.

708
01:06:29,841 --> 01:06:31,301
Grab the hand or the wing...

709
01:06:31,468 --> 01:06:33,845
or the tail of
whoever is closest to you.

710
01:07:15,845 --> 01:07:18,389
Hey, over here! 
Yeah, over here!

711
01:07:18,473 --> 01:07:20,934
Hold formation, guards. 
Hold formation.

712
01:07:22,227 --> 01:07:24,187
-Excuse me, sir.
-Stop right there.

713
01:07:24,354 --> 01:07:25,397
I'm with the bride.

714
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:28,650
We've been told to let the other kind
find their seats first.

715
01:07:28,817 --> 01:07:29,901
But I'm not a human.

716
01:07:30,068 --> 01:07:31,820
-I'm a raven.
-What?

717
01:07:31,986 --> 01:07:34,114
A raven. The black bird.

718
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,866
This rice is delicious.

719
01:07:37,033 --> 01:07:39,577
You're supposed to throw it
at the bride and groom.

720
01:07:39,744 --> 01:07:42,163
What? And waste good rice?

721
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:43,581
What's the hold up?

722
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:45,583
Let me in!

723
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,710
Why can't humans come in, too?

724
01:07:49,379 --> 01:07:50,964
Why can't we come in?

725
01:07:58,304 --> 01:07:59,305
I know it's bad luck...

726
01:07:59,472 --> 01:08:01,141
but I had to see you.

727
01:08:02,767 --> 01:08:03,977
For you.

728
01:08:04,144 --> 01:08:05,812
A Tomb Bloom?

729
01:08:05,979 --> 01:08:06,938
Where did you get this?

730
01:08:07,105 --> 01:08:08,064
From my mother.

731
01:08:08,773 --> 01:08:11,443
The sun's up.
It's our wedding day.

732
01:08:19,075 --> 01:08:21,286
<i>From my mother.</i>

733
01:11:10,497 --> 01:11:12,165
Where should we sit, Flittle?

734
01:11:12,332 --> 01:11:14,209
On the left.
We're with the bride.

735
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:15,877
Yes, we are.

736
01:11:16,044 --> 01:11:17,796
But the groom's lovely, too.

737
01:11:17,962 --> 01:11:19,631
Yes, he is.

738
01:11:20,548 --> 01:11:21,925
I'm with both.

739
01:11:31,976 --> 01:11:32,977
Now.

740
01:11:56,459 --> 01:11:58,128
What's this?

741
01:11:58,294 --> 01:11:59,963
Nobody is allowed in here except me.

742
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:02,882
And I'm already here, so go away!

743
01:12:21,109 --> 01:12:22,569
Maleficent, please stop.

744
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:31,327
Maleficent.

745
01:12:31,494 --> 01:12:32,912
She didn't do it.

746
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:37,625
Get out!

747
01:12:39,419 --> 01:12:40,503
Before I call the guards!

748
01:12:47,469 --> 01:12:48,970
The missing fairies.

749
01:12:49,137 --> 01:12:50,388
I said get out. 
Did you hear me?

750
01:12:50,555 --> 01:12:51,931
What have you done?

751
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,230
You're a pixie.

752
01:12:59,397 --> 01:13:00,690
How dare you call me that?

753
01:13:00,857 --> 01:13:02,817
I'm Lickspittle, the nobleman...

754
01:13:02,984 --> 01:13:04,736
and I serve the queen.

755
01:13:05,528 --> 01:13:07,697
She took your wings.

756
01:13:11,242 --> 01:13:12,744
We have to release them.

757
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:14,954
They belong on the Moors.

758
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:16,122
As you do, Aurora.

759
01:13:18,249 --> 01:13:21,669
A human who has betrayed her kind.

760
01:13:28,259 --> 01:13:30,136
You put the curse on the king.

761
01:13:30,345 --> 01:13:31,888
Oh, dear.

762
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:34,349
You may be queen...

763
01:13:34,933 --> 01:13:36,267
but you are very young.

764
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:39,270
Ruling humans is a bit more complicated...

765
01:13:39,813 --> 01:13:43,650
than running around barefoot
with flowers in your hair.

766
01:13:46,528 --> 01:13:48,530
When I was young...

767
01:13:50,073 --> 01:13:52,659
my family's kingdom bordered the Moors.

768
01:13:52,826 --> 01:13:57,080
And one particularly harsh winter...

769
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,873
our crops died...

770
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,835
and the people began to suffer.

771
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:05,296
And as we looked over our walls...

772
01:14:05,463 --> 01:14:08,508
we could see the fairies thriving.

773
01:14:09,676 --> 01:14:12,429
My brother and I believed we
should take what we needed...

774
01:14:12,595 --> 01:14:17,725
while my father, the king,
sought their kindness.

775
01:14:18,643 --> 01:14:22,522
Choosing peace over our people,
he sent my brother to do his bidding.

776
01:14:23,106 --> 01:14:25,233
He never came back.

777
01:14:26,735 --> 01:14:28,194
Those savages...

778
01:14:28,361 --> 01:14:32,365
creatures who could barely grunt,
let alone engage in talks, killed him.

779
01:14:33,158 --> 01:14:34,451
I don't believe that.

780
01:14:34,617 --> 01:14:35,910
Our people became fearful.

781
01:14:36,077 --> 01:14:38,705
They overthrew my father.

782
01:14:38,872 --> 01:14:41,833
The land fell into chaos.
I was cast out.

783
01:14:42,709 --> 01:14:47,088
Forced by fate into marriage
with King John of Ulstead.

784
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:51,676
Another weak king
speaking of tolerance and civility.

785
01:14:52,218 --> 01:14:54,554
And now, my own son...

786
01:14:54,721 --> 01:14:57,932
corrupted with visions of harmony.

787
01:14:58,725 --> 01:15:01,186
But peace will not be our downfall.

788
01:15:06,274 --> 01:15:08,068
Now lock her up.

789
01:15:09,194 --> 01:15:11,196
A war is coming.

790
01:15:16,993 --> 01:15:18,953
No! No!

791
01:15:27,378 --> 01:15:29,798
I wish you could be here with me.

792
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:40,517
Conall wanted peace...

793
01:15:42,727 --> 01:15:45,480
<i>and they filled him with iron.</i>

794
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:49,359
Now, we will have our war.

795
01:15:51,444 --> 01:15:54,572
Our fight begins now!

796
01:15:55,824 --> 01:15:57,325
We will rise together!

797
01:15:57,992 --> 01:15:59,619
We fight together.

798
01:15:59,869 --> 01:16:04,249
And we will show them no mercy!

799
01:16:21,224 --> 01:16:23,393
Come on! Go!

800
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:29,399
Go! Go!

801
01:16:30,734 --> 01:16:33,361
Go! Go! Go!

802
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:49,002
Where are all Philip's guests?

803
01:16:49,169 --> 01:16:51,379
Humans are poor timekeepers.

804
01:17:18,031 --> 01:17:20,325
Start the music.

805
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,761
Come on! Come on!

806
01:18:43,867 --> 01:18:44,868
She's gone.

807
01:18:46,619 --> 01:18:47,537
Hey!

808
01:18:57,964 --> 01:19:00,425
It's a trap! Get down!

809
01:19:19,194 --> 01:19:20,570
Your Majesty...

810
01:19:21,696 --> 01:19:24,074
they're coming from the sea.

811
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:34,751
She escaped!

812
01:19:41,508 --> 01:19:43,468
Down this way, come on!

813
01:19:51,059 --> 01:19:52,477
Your Highness.

814
01:19:52,644 --> 01:19:54,062
Upon my command.

815
01:20:04,656 --> 01:20:05,865
Check every room!

816
01:20:08,243 --> 01:20:09,411
She can't be far!

817
01:20:42,444 --> 01:20:43,361
Wait.

818
01:20:44,821 --> 01:20:45,989
Wait.

819
01:21:09,637 --> 01:21:11,389
What's going on?

820
01:21:15,685 --> 01:21:16,686
Now.

821
01:21:17,062 --> 01:21:18,104
Fire!

822
01:21:27,489 --> 01:21:28,823
No!

823
01:21:55,558 --> 01:21:57,644
They look just like her.

824
01:22:01,648 --> 01:22:03,149
Withdraw!

825
01:22:03,316 --> 01:22:05,360
Withdraw!

826
01:22:06,319 --> 01:22:08,029
Pull back!

827
01:22:08,196 --> 01:22:09,572
Maleficent's starting a war.

828
01:22:09,739 --> 01:22:11,908
First my father, and now this.

829
01:22:12,075 --> 01:22:14,244
Philip! She didn't curse him.

830
01:22:14,411 --> 01:22:16,037
-Maleficent.
-What?

831
01:22:16,538 --> 01:22:18,248
She never cursed him.

832
01:22:19,374 --> 01:22:21,000
It was your mother.

833
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:22,377
What are you saying?

834
01:22:22,544 --> 01:22:23,753
It was the spindle.

835
01:22:29,008 --> 01:22:30,552
The curse is still in it.

836
01:22:30,927 --> 01:22:33,555
Your mother used it against your father.

837
01:22:35,306 --> 01:22:36,724
Look.

838
01:22:39,227 --> 01:22:40,103
It's the same.

839
01:22:40,979 --> 01:22:43,523
She's locked the Moor folk in the chapel.

840
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:44,899
This isn't a wedding.

841
01:22:45,066 --> 01:22:47,068
It's a trap.

842
01:22:51,781 --> 01:22:54,200
Remember where you came from.

843
01:22:55,034 --> 01:22:57,162
Remember who you are.

844
01:23:00,415 --> 01:23:02,333
I've made my choice.

845
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,462
You'll have to make yours.

846
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:35,283
Stay low!

847
01:23:37,577 --> 01:23:38,703
Divide!

848
01:23:40,997 --> 01:23:42,499
Follow me!

849
01:23:51,466 --> 01:23:52,509
Attack!

850
01:23:53,885 --> 01:23:55,386
Attack!

851
01:24:06,439 --> 01:24:08,191
-Ignite!
-Ignite!

852
01:24:18,535 --> 01:24:19,536
No!

853
01:25:04,038 --> 01:25:05,290
Aunties!
Aunties!

854
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:09,836
It's too heavy!

855
01:25:11,171 --> 01:25:12,380
Aurora!

856
01:25:12,547 --> 01:25:13,757
Diaval! You're here.

857
01:25:17,927 --> 01:25:19,554
What's happening?

858
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:40,533
Weapon change!

859
01:25:42,494 --> 01:25:43,661
Weapon change! Go!

860
01:26:24,035 --> 01:26:25,036
Mother!

861
01:26:25,954 --> 01:26:27,330
You have to stop this.

862
01:26:27,497 --> 01:26:28,957
We are at war.

863
01:26:29,124 --> 01:26:31,000
This isn't a war. 
It's a massacre.

864
01:26:31,167 --> 01:26:32,669
Philip, you don't understand.

865
01:26:32,836 --> 01:26:35,505
These creatures stand between us...

866
01:26:35,672 --> 01:26:38,258
and everything we need to survive.

867
01:26:38,425 --> 01:26:39,676
You're wrong.

868
01:26:39,843 --> 01:26:41,219
We can stand together.

869
01:26:41,386 --> 01:26:44,097
Well, you're a fool to believe that.

870
01:26:44,264 --> 01:26:47,559
You don't know what it takes
to fight for our kind.

871
01:26:48,435 --> 01:26:49,769
You lied to me.

872
01:26:50,812 --> 01:26:52,772
I am protecting the kingdom...

873
01:26:52,939 --> 01:26:55,191
and your throne.

874
01:26:55,608 --> 01:26:56,818
What about Father?

875
01:26:58,445 --> 01:27:01,489
Were you protecting him, too?

876
01:27:03,825 --> 01:27:06,244
The prince is not feeling well.

877
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:09,289
See him to his chambers.

878
01:27:13,209 --> 01:27:14,127
Now.

879
01:27:18,631 --> 01:27:19,841
Sire, stop!

880
01:27:46,826 --> 01:27:49,079
Yield! Yield!

881
01:27:49,245 --> 01:27:50,955
My mother cursed the king
so she could destroy the Moor folk.

882
01:27:51,456 --> 01:27:53,541
Your men are paying heavily for it.

883
01:28:00,423 --> 01:28:02,467
We have to do something!

884
01:28:06,429 --> 01:28:07,847
Goodbye, girls.

885
01:28:09,182 --> 01:28:10,975
No, come back!

886
01:28:11,309 --> 01:28:13,061
Flittle! No!

887
01:28:25,657 --> 01:28:26,950
No!

888
01:28:27,117 --> 01:28:28,952
Hey, you, stay with your own!

889
01:28:29,577 --> 01:28:31,121
Run, Aurora, run!

890
01:28:31,287 --> 01:28:32,956
Let him go!

891
01:28:37,585 --> 01:28:39,671
No! No!

892
01:29:06,823 --> 01:29:08,575
Godmother.

893
01:30:06,883 --> 01:30:08,593
For Flittle!

894
01:30:17,143 --> 01:30:18,311
We've got her!

895
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:08,069
Go! Go!

896
01:31:08,236 --> 01:31:10,780
This way! This way!

897
01:31:10,947 --> 01:31:11,906
Go!

898
01:31:55,158 --> 01:31:56,534
Stand down!

899
01:31:58,328 --> 01:31:59,746
This is not my fight.

900
01:32:00,538 --> 01:32:03,083
My mother wanted a war,
and you're giving it to her.

901
01:32:04,876 --> 01:32:07,754
I won't allow her hatred
to ruin my kingdom or yours.

902
01:32:26,147 --> 01:32:27,941
There will be no
Fey blood on my hands.

903
01:32:49,879 --> 01:32:51,840
This way!
This way!

904
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,885
Maleficent's back!

905
01:33:00,557 --> 01:33:03,017
She's going for the queen.

906
01:33:08,773 --> 01:33:10,608
Yield! Yield!

907
01:33:10,775 --> 01:33:11,776
Stand down!

908
01:33:11,943 --> 01:33:13,278
Lower your weapons!

909
01:33:25,582 --> 01:33:28,376
There's the evil that I promised them.

910
01:33:31,963 --> 01:33:34,591
Your kind is more predictable than humans.

911
01:33:41,139 --> 01:33:42,140
Stop!

912
01:33:43,016 --> 01:33:43,933
Stop!

913
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:46,227
Well, almost.

914
01:33:46,561 --> 01:33:47,604
Stop.

915
01:33:47,771 --> 01:33:50,774
I'm sorry I doubted you,
but this isn't you.

916
01:33:51,107 --> 01:33:52,901
There's another way.

917
01:33:53,068 --> 01:33:54,277
I know who you are.

918
01:33:56,821 --> 01:33:59,157
I know you.

919
01:33:59,699 --> 01:34:01,201
You do not.

920
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:05,830
Yes, I do.

921
01:34:06,414 --> 01:34:08,249
You're my mother.

922
01:34:43,368 --> 01:34:44,661
No!

923
01:35:00,427 --> 01:35:02,929
Do you know what
makes a great leader, Aurora?

924
01:35:04,222 --> 01:35:07,308
The ability to instill fear
in your subjects...

925
01:35:07,475 --> 01:35:08,685
and then use that fear...

926
01:35:08,852 --> 01:35:09,811
Your Majesty.

927
01:35:11,396 --> 01:35:13,606
...against your enemies.

928
01:35:14,107 --> 01:35:15,358
So...

929
01:35:16,401 --> 01:35:19,738
I spread the story of the evil witch...

930
01:35:19,904 --> 01:35:22,574
and the princess she cursed.

931
01:35:23,533 --> 01:35:27,287
It didn't matter who woke Sleeping Beauty.

932
01:35:28,163 --> 01:35:30,123
They were all terrified.

933
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:33,418
And the story became legend.

934
01:35:35,712 --> 01:35:37,797
I know you think I'm a monster.

935
01:35:38,381 --> 01:35:43,344
But what I did to the king,
to Maleficent, to my son...

936
01:35:44,137 --> 01:35:47,098
I did for Ulstead.

937
01:35:47,265 --> 01:35:51,728
You are a traitor to your kind,
and you will pay for it.

938
01:35:52,771 --> 01:35:54,898
Maleficent is dead!

939
01:35:57,901 --> 01:36:00,111
We will never again live in fear!

940
01:36:01,112 --> 01:36:02,614
Get back here!

941
01:36:06,493 --> 01:36:08,745
Ulstead is free at last!

942
01:36:09,788 --> 01:36:11,623
Let me go!

943
01:36:20,215 --> 01:36:21,341
What's happening?

944
01:39:47,005 --> 01:39:48,840
Well, well.

945
01:39:49,799 --> 01:39:51,968
Hello, Beasty.

946
01:40:10,612 --> 01:40:11,654
I missed you.

947
01:40:13,406 --> 01:40:14,908
Did you bump your head, then?

948
01:40:15,408 --> 01:40:16,576
I did.

949
01:40:19,537 --> 01:40:20,872
Philip.

950
01:40:21,331 --> 01:40:22,749
Yes?

951
01:40:24,584 --> 01:40:26,419
Do you love my daughter?

952
01:40:29,422 --> 01:40:30,715
With everything I have.

953
01:40:39,974 --> 01:40:41,142
Good.

954
01:40:49,901 --> 01:40:53,029
I believe this belongs to you.

955
01:40:59,744 --> 01:41:01,788
Curses don't end.

956
01:41:01,955 --> 01:41:03,665
They're broken.

957
01:41:29,065 --> 01:41:30,817
It ends.

958
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:38,908
There will be no more fighting.

959
01:41:39,409 --> 01:41:41,953
Ulstead will never attack
the Moors again.

960
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:43,413
And from this day on...

961
01:41:44,205 --> 01:41:46,416
we move forward...

962
01:41:46,833 --> 01:41:49,169
and find our way...

963
01:41:50,253 --> 01:41:51,671
in peace.

964
01:41:52,172 --> 01:41:53,631
Together.

965
01:41:56,968 --> 01:41:59,262
Today, there will be a wedding.

966
01:41:59,721 --> 01:42:03,057
Not just a union of two people...

967
01:42:03,224 --> 01:42:06,227
but a union of two kingdoms.

968
01:42:06,394 --> 01:42:07,896
And all are invited...

969
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:10,940
all are safe...

970
01:42:11,107 --> 01:42:13,318
and all are welcome.

971
01:42:47,477 --> 01:42:49,229
Hello, there.

972
01:43:30,186 --> 01:43:33,231
We cannot live amongst monsters...

973
01:43:38,695 --> 01:43:41,865
Someone should really cover those horns.

974
01:43:58,923 --> 01:44:00,675
If only Conall could see you.

975
01:44:02,844 --> 01:44:03,845
Borra...

976
01:44:06,014 --> 01:44:08,224
it's time to come home.

977
01:44:14,731 --> 01:44:16,107
Hello.

978
01:44:17,692 --> 01:44:19,652
Can you come here?

979
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,247
Yes?

980
01:44:33,166 --> 01:44:34,959
Will you give me away?

981
01:44:35,335 --> 01:44:36,795
Never.

982
01:44:37,962 --> 01:44:39,297
No.

983
01:44:39,923 --> 01:44:41,382
Will you walk me down the aisle?

984
01:44:46,096 --> 01:44:47,013
Yes.

985
01:45:10,328 --> 01:45:12,539
Apologies to anyone
I might have mauled today.

986
01:45:25,135 --> 01:45:25,927
Is that...?

987
01:45:26,761 --> 01:45:28,555
She can change her back.

988
01:45:29,389 --> 01:45:30,515
I suppose.

989
01:45:30,682 --> 01:45:33,184
Only if we wanted to.

990
01:45:34,894 --> 01:45:36,396
Father.

991
01:45:41,109 --> 01:45:43,278
I'm so glad to see you.

992
01:45:43,445 --> 01:45:45,488
I've dreamed of this moment.

993
01:45:45,655 --> 01:45:47,907
Two kingdoms united at last.

994
01:45:48,533 --> 01:45:50,660
And it's because of you.

995
01:45:51,453 --> 01:45:53,997
I'm so proud of you. So proud.

996
01:46:23,318 --> 01:46:24,611
She looks better in green.

997
01:46:24,778 --> 01:46:25,904
Pink, you mean.

998
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:30,366
No, in green.

999
01:46:31,242 --> 01:46:31,951
Pink.

1000
01:46:32,118 --> 01:46:33,411
-Green.
-Pink.

1001
01:46:36,581 --> 01:46:37,957
Flittle!

1002
01:46:38,124 --> 01:46:40,418
It's perfect.

1003
01:47:24,796 --> 01:47:26,589
Let her go.

1004
01:47:40,228 --> 01:47:42,605
Pull yourself together.

1005
01:47:42,981 --> 01:47:46,067
We are here to join
two kingdoms...

1006
01:47:46,234 --> 01:47:47,861
divided by fear.

1007
01:47:48,737 --> 01:47:53,783
Today, you teach us
we are not defined by where we are from...

1008
01:47:53,950 --> 01:47:56,161
but by whom we love.

1009
01:47:58,204 --> 01:47:59,789
The bands, please.

1010
01:48:15,513 --> 01:48:18,308
-Do you, Philip, take Aurora...
-I do.

1011
01:48:19,934 --> 01:48:22,228
-And do you, Aurora, take...
-I do.

1012
01:48:22,854 --> 01:48:26,524
Then I pronounce you husband and wife.

1013
01:48:26,691 --> 01:48:28,735
You may kiss the bride.

1014
01:48:59,516 --> 01:49:00,558
You're smiling.

1015
01:49:23,498 --> 01:49:25,166
It's a new day.

1016
01:49:27,669 --> 01:49:29,379
It is.

1017
01:49:40,974 --> 01:49:42,016
Morning.

1018
01:49:42,892 --> 01:49:44,978
Will you stay awhile?

1019
01:49:45,145 --> 01:49:46,396
A little while.

1020
01:49:46,813 --> 01:49:48,690
But don't worry...

1021
01:49:48,857 --> 01:49:51,359
I'll see you at the christening.
