1
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:58,361
Dad, let's eat.

2
00:00:58,444 --> 00:00:59,445
Okay.

3
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,286
What's all this?

4
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,455
We're eating meat
first thing in the morning?

5
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:10,414
Yes.

6
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:13,501
Do you usually eat like this?

7
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,753
Or did you make this specially for me?

8
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,339
A bit of both.

9
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:20,758
Bingo. You get ten out of ten
for that answer.

10
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:23,386
Let's eat.

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,055
Just a second.

12
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:29,809
HYE-JUN

13
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:34,981
-Hey.
-<i>Did I call too early?</i>

14
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:36,691
I'm just having breakfast with Dad.

15
00:01:36,774 --> 00:01:38,609
-<i>Your dad came over?</i>
-Yes.

16
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:40,695
That's why
you haven't checked the messages.

17
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:42,864
I thought something was up.

18
00:01:43,823 --> 00:01:45,741
-You were worried?
-It's all good now.

19
00:01:46,284 --> 00:01:48,494
Enjoy your breakfast
and have a good day at work.

20
00:01:49,453 --> 00:01:51,330
All right, you too.

21
00:01:55,543 --> 00:01:57,211
You got a boyfriend?

22
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,800
Yes.

23
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:06,470
I have many questions,

24
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:08,472
but I won't ask.

25
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:09,557
Thanks, Dad.

26
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:12,393
I'll tell you lots of stuff
when the time's right.

27
00:02:12,935 --> 00:02:13,936
Sounds good.

28
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:20,109
Now, I'll tell you the real reason

29
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:21,611
I came to see you.

30
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:28,034
Don't be too nervous.
Just be natural, Grandpa.

31
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:30,077
Why are you thanking me?

32
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:32,788
It's your first ad shoot.
Of course, I remember it.

33
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:39,170
Yes, I should be able to go home today.

34
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:43,341
Okay, got it. Good luck.

35
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:45,718
All right.

36
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:56,520
JI-A

37
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:03,653
Hello?

38
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:05,363
You haven't changed your number.

39
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:06,614
What's up?

40
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:08,866
<i>Gosh, I'm going nuts.</i>

41
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,494
The exam is coming up,
and I'm so stressed out.

42
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:13,287
You always do well.

43
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:14,330
It'll be fine.

44
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:17,833
Where are you?
It sounds like you're outside.

45
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:19,627
I'm at a shoot.

46
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,712
I want to go somewhere.

47
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:25,758
I used to tag along
whenever you had a show. Remember?

48
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:28,010
It's all in the past.

49
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:38,813
I saved some money to give you
when you get married.

50
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:41,857
If you don't accept this,
I'll get really mad at you.

51
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,904
I've started painting again.

52
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,198
I'm glad to hear that.

53
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:53,369
To tell you the truth,
it's been a few years.

54
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:56,038
But I was too embarrassed to tell you.

55
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,541
I'll have an exhibition soon.

56
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:03,462
Do you know why I started painting again?

57
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:07,341
I don't know.

58
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,885
To show you.

59
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,142
I'll work hard
and live my life to the fullest.

60
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:20,062
I know that I ruined your childhood,

61
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:25,443
but I want to be remembered as someone
who cherished his life

62
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:27,987
and did his best.

63
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:51,152
RECORD OF YOUTH

64
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:56,390
It's for the Industry-Academy
Cooperation's mentoring program,

65
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,184
so this would be good.

66
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:00,394
I just want to wear plain white.

67
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,272
This is plain too. It's sky blue.

68
00:05:03,356 --> 00:05:06,442
Just listen to me.
Nothing bad will come out of it.

69
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:09,111
Are you sure about that?

70
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,239
What will you do about Hae-hyo?

71
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:14,158
What did you say about the new drama?

72
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:17,995
I watched a little bit of it,
and Park Do-ha totally outshines him.

73
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:20,623
You said he'll be a star.

74
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:23,542
Or is it just that I don't see it yet?

75
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:26,253
Don't be so hard on me.

76
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:29,131
The script is centered
around the main characters.

77
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,467
Considering that,
I'd say he's doing pretty well.

78
00:05:33,177 --> 00:05:34,762
"Pretty well"?

79
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:38,933
I didn't let you have your way
to hear crap like that.

80
00:05:39,016 --> 00:05:41,268
Your masterpiece, Won Hae-hyo,

81
00:05:41,852 --> 00:05:43,896
needs an interim check.

82
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,524
Hae-na is doing so well.

83
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:51,112
If I had my way,
he'd be doing his MBA in the US now.

84
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:52,738
And what use is that?

85
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:55,282
It's not like he'll be a professor
or work as a salary man.

86
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:57,868
Getting firsthand experience
is much better.

87
00:05:57,952 --> 00:06:01,872
He can live a great life with his
modeling and acting experiences alone.

88
00:06:01,956 --> 00:06:03,541
What does he think?

89
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:13,759
Hey, let's talk.

90
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:16,679
I have to go out.

91
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:17,888
It won't take long.

92
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:25,479
I think you're due for an interim check.

93
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,898
WON HAE-HYO MAKES AN IMPRESSION

94
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:29,483
WHERE HAS HE BEEN ALL THIS TIME?

95
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:34,989
WON HAE-HYO

96
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:37,408
WON HAE-HYO'S ACTING SKILLS
COME INTO QUESTION

97
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:40,744
I analyzed all the articles
about the dramas and movies you've done.

98
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:45,082
I didn't know you were interested
in what I do.

99
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,126
I'm interested in your life

100
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:49,253
because it's connected to mine.

101
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:52,464
When do you plan to enlist?

102
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:55,759
Based on my analysis,

103
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:58,179
I think you should enlist now.

104
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:03,559
-I'm thinking about it.
-I'm glad to hear that you actually do.

105
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:08,022
-Dad.
-It means you've lost my trust.

106
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:09,356
Are you your mom's puppet?

107
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,983
You say that you're independent,

108
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:13,194
but you're just following her guidelines.

109
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:15,529
That's because
I don't want to fight with Mom.

110
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:16,780
I'm doing all I can.

111
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:20,117
What is it that you want to be?
A star or an actor?

112
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:25,206
-An actor.
-Then why agree to be in <i>Catch</i>?

113
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:28,501
You're only supporting Park Do-ha.

114
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:31,420
Your actions never match your words.

115
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:33,422
How did you end up like this?

116
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:36,634
I let you and your mother
do as you please.

117
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:39,637
Now, it's about time you showed me
some results that prove

118
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:41,430
your choice was right.

119
00:07:42,556 --> 00:07:43,516
Otherwise, just quit.

120
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,689
"Results"?

121
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,151
"Interim check"?

122
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:56,695
He's being ridiculous.

123
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:00,699
He always steps in and tries
to take credit for end results.

124
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,251
What is it, Mom?

125
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:14,338
Your dad isn't completely wrong.

126
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:15,673
What did I tell you?

127
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:18,467
I told you I didn't like <i>Catch</i>
when I first read the script.

128
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:20,177
Why bring it up now?

129
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:23,514
We should talk about it
so you don't repeat the same mistake.

130
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:25,724
Gosh, I'm so upset.

131
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:27,351
Are you more upset than I am?

132
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:34,275
I want you to be more aggressive.

133
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,235
You're too naive.

134
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:39,154
Maybe it's because we're well-off.
You have no backbone.

135
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:43,033
Doesn't seeing Hye-jun
make you want to work harder?

136
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,537
Of course,
I know that he's not a big deal now.

137
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,539
But there's a thing called momentum.

138
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:51,125
It looks like he's on the rise.

139
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,460
What about me? Am I going downhill?

140
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:56,797
No, you're stagnant.
Your graph is drawing a straight line.

141
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,091
I thought you were supporting my choice.

142
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:02,052
What did you say when I supported you?

143
00:09:02,136 --> 00:09:05,347
You told me to stay out of it
and said you can take care of everything.

144
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:07,308
And I did take care of everything.

145
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,976
Do you really think so?

146
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,274
<i>Catch</i> didn't do as well
as I thought it would,

147
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:17,026
but I'll get a lead role next time.

148
00:09:17,651 --> 00:09:18,611
I'm not done yet.

149
00:09:19,403 --> 00:09:22,364
Both you and Dad…
Don't you think this is too much?

150
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:24,283
Both your dad and I know

151
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:26,785
that this is a critical time for you.

152
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:31,081
You have to decide whether
you'll enlist now or postpone it.

153
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:33,083
I'll postpone it.

154
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:36,378
I can't enlist until I prove myself.

155
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:44,178
Ma'am.

156
00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:47,514
I'd like to talk to you about something.

157
00:09:48,974 --> 00:09:51,518
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

158
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:01,320
I heard you were leaving.

159
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:03,781
I was hurt a little.

160
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:05,532
I thought I treated you well.

161
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:07,076
You did.

162
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,870
Thank you for being so good to me.

163
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:13,332
Will Hae-hyo and Hye-jun leave with you?

164
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,250
I'm not sure.

165
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,169
I won't stop anyone from leaving.

166
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:21,590
I won't hire your replacement right away.
Let me know when you're sorted.

167
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:24,218
May I talk to Jin-ju for a moment

168
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:26,595
before we open?

169
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,390
Do you need to talk to her
to sort things out?

170
00:10:41,485 --> 00:10:42,486
You should eat, too.

171
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:45,239
So what's this about?

172
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:48,242
I don't feel comfortable eating with you.

173
00:10:48,784 --> 00:10:52,121
Same here.
That's why I'm trying to overcome it.

174
00:10:58,544 --> 00:10:59,628
Jin-ju.

175
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,715
-What?
-I'll call you that from now on.

176
00:11:02,798 --> 00:11:03,924
I'm leaving the salon.

177
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:06,885
I'm no longer your junior,
so I'll just address you casually.

178
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:08,679
Jeez.

179
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:11,974
You really get on my nerves.

180
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:15,144
I don't want to stay acquainted with you.

181
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:16,729
I don't like you either,

182
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:18,939
but I'm going to try to like you.

183
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:22,609
Addressing you differently
might make you a bit more likable,

184
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:23,777
so that's what I'll do.

185
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:25,404
I can't stand this. I'm leaving.

186
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:31,702
<i>But one good thing about it is that
it's giving me so much energy.</i>

187
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:35,080
<i>The wheels are turning in my head
to come up with a way to kick you out.</i>

188
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:37,749
<i>I'm realizing that I should just pity you.</i>

189
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,376
<i>How dare you!</i>

190
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,629
-Are you blackmailing me?
-<i>Now that I know…</i>

191
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:46,633
You have three options,
and you can take your pick.

192
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:50,679
First, I send this video to everyone.

193
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:53,765
Second, I gather everyone
and play this in front of them.

194
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:56,560
Third, you apologize to me.

195
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:58,645
If you apologize, I'll delete this.

196
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:00,147
How can I trust you?

197
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,566
Right? How can you trust me?

198
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:04,860
I may change my word
after you apologize to me.

199
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:16,330
DO-HA

200
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,210
Hey, Do-ha.

201
00:12:22,044 --> 00:12:23,253
Did something good happen?

202
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:27,090
No, I feel so down that
I'm consciously trying to lift my spirits.

203
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:29,009
Both of my parents nagged me like crazy.

204
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:31,094
I want to hear some nagging.

205
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:33,680
No one dares to nag me anymore.

206
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:35,516
-What are you doing?
-Pilates.

207
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:38,227
-Where are you?
-<i>I'm still in London.</i>

208
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,686
<i>Did you not see my post?</i>

209
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,231
<i>I posted a photo while watching
Son Heung-min's game.</i>

210
00:12:42,314 --> 00:12:43,315
I haven't seen it yet.

211
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:47,110
Oh, right.
You have almost one million followers.

212
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:48,737
Why do you have so many? It's fishy.

213
00:12:49,488 --> 00:12:51,114
<i>I mean, what have you even done?</i>

214
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:52,991
Can't you be any nicer?

215
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:55,118
I'm nice, aren't I?

216
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:58,038
You know me pretty well now.
What are you doing after Pilates?

217
00:12:58,121 --> 00:12:59,414
Going to the salon.

218
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:00,624
You still go there?

219
00:13:00,707 --> 00:13:03,001
I told you to switch to the salon I go to.

220
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:06,463
I don't want to. You have the habit
of forcing others to do what you like.

221
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:08,257
That's true.

222
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:12,302
Do you like Jeong-ha?
Is that why you can't switch?

223
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:16,515
<i>I've dated a makeup artist,
and from my experience--</i>

224
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:17,975
You're so chatty today.

225
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:19,810
-Don't you have any friends?
-No.

226
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:23,438
Oh, Hye-jun is starting
a new drama, right?

227
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:25,524
I hope he fails.

228
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:28,860
-You're out of line.
<i>-Let's be honest, okay?</i>

229
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:30,362
<i>Our drama didn't do so well.</i>

230
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:32,030
<i>I'd be upset if he was successful.</i>

231
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:36,243
Tae-su is here.
I have to head out early for a shoot.

232
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:38,203
Okay.

233
00:13:53,594 --> 00:13:55,095
Why take a photo of that?

234
00:13:55,762 --> 00:13:57,848
This is my vibe
on social media these days.

235
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,309
Stuff like this makes you look cool.

236
00:14:00,392 --> 00:14:03,687
Because I'm so fabulous,
the props have to be simple.

237
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,397
Don't post too often.

238
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:07,441
Things can go bad in a flash.

239
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:11,320
You have to keep posting photos
to gain more followers.

240
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:17,159
You can just pay
to increase your follower count.

241
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:18,118
What do you mean?

242
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:20,245
There are companies that do that.

243
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:22,873
Send them money,
and they'll do it for you.

244
00:14:22,956 --> 00:14:25,417
I used that service
when I ran the model agency.

245
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,836
Models tend to lose their jobs

246
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,713
when they're not popular enough.

247
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:33,050
Well, enough about the old days.

248
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,801
Did you do that for Hae-hyo?

249
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:36,970
Hey, he is a completely different story.

250
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:38,889
I never managed his social media.

251
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:50,901
Director, after Yi Geon is kicked out
of the palace,

252
00:14:50,984 --> 00:14:52,444
we skip about five years.

253
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:55,197
It'd be nice to change up the atmosphere.

254
00:14:56,031 --> 00:15:00,077
It's difficult to do that
because this is a historical drama.

255
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:04,164
Director, have some <i>patbingsu</i>.

256
00:15:04,247 --> 00:15:06,458
-Who got this?
-Hye-jun's girlfriend, I think.

257
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,751
She's very pretty.

258
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:09,461
What?

259
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:11,380
There she is.

260
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:25,185
Why are you here?

261
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:27,187
What? I'm here to give you moral support.

262
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,189
You must be the director.

263
00:15:30,148 --> 00:15:33,151
Hello, Director.
I'm a friend of Hye-jun's.

264
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:34,861
It's too hot, isn't it?

265
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:36,196
We're used to it.

266
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,990
I'm in law school.

267
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:39,908
I'll be joining a law firm soon,

268
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:41,743
so I'll give you a discount.

269
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:44,079
That's how you greet someone?

270
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:46,456
It's not good to ever need a lawyer.

271
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,837
You two really must be just friends.

272
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,047
You don't seem excited at all
to see each other.

273
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:04,474
This is nice.

274
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:07,686
I can breathe now that I'm not in Seoul.

275
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:09,146
Don't do this again.

276
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:12,274
I feel guilty
that I'm taking a walk with you.

277
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:15,444
Hey, even a married man
wouldn't act like you.

278
00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:17,279
I know you.

279
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,323
You always sneak back in
as if nothing's happened.

280
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:21,992
I really missed this.

281
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:24,327
You know so much about me,

282
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:26,538
and you're brutally honest with me.

283
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:28,457
It hurts, but I like it.

284
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,666
I must be a pervert.

285
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,918
This is why I can't forget you.

286
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:34,379
You'll find another man like that.

287
00:16:34,463 --> 00:16:36,506
I'm not the Jung Ji-a you used to know.

288
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,800
I can speak up in front of my parents now.

289
00:16:38,884 --> 00:16:41,511
And I'll be financially independent
when I join a law firm.

290
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:47,017
I've changed too.

291
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:54,107
Okay, even I can't stand
how clingy I am right now.

292
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:55,942
-Let's just be friends.
-Can you do it?

293
00:16:56,818 --> 00:16:59,279
Why do you think I can't?

294
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:02,783
Why did we break up?
Don't forget I dumped you both times.

295
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:03,867
Look at this.

296
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,329
You're attacking me now
because I've hurt your pride.

297
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:10,290
Try to be more stable emotionally.

298
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,084
Don't say what you know about me.

299
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,251
It makes my heart skip.

300
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:16,922
I can't be friends with you.

301
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:49,996
It'll take about three hours
to arrive in Seoul, so take a nap.

302
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:59,422
Gosh, who is it?
I wanted you to get some sleep.

303
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:02,884
I won't sleep just because you tell me to.

304
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:05,512
You've had shoots back to back.
You must be tired.

305
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:07,264
Who'd look out for you if I didn't?

306
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:14,437
<i>When will you be back in Seoul?</i>

307
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:18,400
<i>I'm on my way back now.</i>

308
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:20,944
JEONG-HA

309
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,656
Hey, Jeong-ha.

310
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:27,409
I felt bad I had to hang up like that
because of my dad.

311
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:28,994
Did he leave?

312
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:30,328
Yes.

313
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,831
Gosh, hearing your voice
is making me miss you more.

314
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:34,499
Then we'll meet up.

315
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,460
I still have a few more hours.

316
00:18:37,544 --> 00:18:40,255
Besides, where can we meet?
Many people recognize you now.

317
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:42,883
I'll come over to your place.

318
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:46,845
Oh, I never thought of that.

319
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:48,930
I'll send you my door code.

320
00:18:49,014 --> 00:18:50,640
Wait for me at my place.

321
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:53,435
Jeong-ha, Hae-hyo is here.

322
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:54,519
Okay.

323
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:56,521
I have to go.

324
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:58,773
My client is here, Won Hae-hyo.

325
00:18:58,857 --> 00:18:59,900
<i>All right.</i>

326
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:01,193
Bye.

327
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:19,878
I won't drive you all the way there.

328
00:19:19,961 --> 00:19:21,129
Okay.

329
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,925
Make sure you don't get a photo taken
while holding each other.

330
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:26,760
-Min-jae.
-I'm talking to you now

331
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:28,762
as the CEO of JJamppong Entertainment.

332
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:31,640
I don't want to see you on tabloids.
Many eyes are on you now.

333
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:35,727
I don't think I'm that famous yet,
but I'll be careful.

334
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,855
-Those articles will stress Jeong-ha.
-Gosh, I can't stand you.

335
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:41,066
Go home and rest. I can go home on my own.

336
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:42,192
Okay.

337
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:00,877
Are you tired?

338
00:20:03,546 --> 00:20:04,547
I'm upset.

339
00:20:05,215 --> 00:20:07,384
Why? You didn't have a good lunch?

340
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:09,552
Can't you take me seriously?

341
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:14,349
Don't be all intimidated.

342
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:16,101
I feel bad now.

343
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:21,523
My dear client, I will do my very best

344
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:24,651
so you will love the makeup.

345
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:30,657
Am I just a client to you?

346
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:35,996
I feel like you'll get mad at me
no matter what I say.

347
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:38,623
Still, I'd rather you be angry at me

348
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:40,417
than be upset with something else.

349
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:47,674
That's better.
I could sense some affection.

350
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:51,761
Was that what you were after?

351
00:20:51,845 --> 00:20:54,389
Here comes the skin toner
with a ton of affection.

352
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:14,492
Which actor are you closest to?

353
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:15,702
Sa Hye-jun.

354
00:21:17,704 --> 00:21:19,706
You didn't even hesitate for a second.

355
00:21:20,707 --> 00:21:23,001
Wouldn't this hurt Do-ha's feelings?

356
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:26,004
During his interview,
he named you as his closest friend.

357
00:21:27,297 --> 00:21:30,300
Everyone knows Hye-jun's been
my best friend since elementary school.

358
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:33,595
Similar backgrounds and hobbies,
I presume?

359
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:35,055
No, not really.

360
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:38,224
Hye-jun's family isn't well-off.

361
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:42,228
By the way,
do you have any questions about me?

362
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:48,860
I actually know your mother well.

363
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:50,528
I've heard a lot about you.

364
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:52,113
I see.

365
00:21:53,156 --> 00:21:54,532
I'll write you a good article.

366
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,951
Let's take more photos.

367
00:21:57,035 --> 00:21:58,953
Wouldn't the rooftop be nice?

368
00:21:59,037 --> 00:22:00,914
We should take some photos outside.

369
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:06,294
I guess the interview is done.

370
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:11,091
Well done.

371
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,895
<i>Can I open your fridge?</i>

372
00:22:52,674 --> 00:22:53,925
THE PC IS SHUTTING DOWN

373
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:55,135
Good work, everyone.

374
00:22:55,218 --> 00:22:56,803
-Good work.
-Thank you.

375
00:22:56,886 --> 00:22:58,221
-Good job today.
-Well done.

376
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:02,517
Great job today.

377
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,561
-Good work.
-Let's go home.

378
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:06,771
When will I get Hye-jun's autograph?

379
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:09,399
Must I ask you like this?

380
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:11,609
I'm asking because
I'm sick of waiting around.

381
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:14,112
I rarely see him these days
because he's so busy.

382
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:17,031
Lucky you. I've seen him in so many ads.

383
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:19,367
I see him on TV and also in theaters.

384
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,494
Gosh, what does it have to do with me?

385
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:23,705
What are you talking about?
You're his brother.

386
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:26,291
-His one and only brother.
-Goodness.

387
00:23:26,374 --> 00:23:30,086
But he's useless.
He can't even get me his autograph.

388
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,088
Ma'am, please. I'll get you one.

389
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:35,300
Even if you do, I'm already upset.
What will you do about that?

390
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:38,011
-I'll buy you a meal.
-Thank you.

391
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:40,930
There's a new seafood soup place
across the street.

392
00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:43,725
-We should go there.
-Okay, let's do that.

393
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:45,059
Yes, ma'am!

394
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:49,063
What? "We"?

395
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:53,151
By any chance,
do you know a man named Charlie Jung?

396
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:56,321
He's a very famous designer.
Has Hye-jun told you about him?

397
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:58,865
-No, never.
-I see.

398
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,244
These bastards need a lesson.

399
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,370
Here, look.

400
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:06,080
Gosh.

401
00:24:07,624 --> 00:24:10,501
He and Charlie Jung dated?
Does it even make sense?

402
00:24:11,002 --> 00:24:12,212
<i>He's provoking me.</i>

403
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:14,714
<i>Why show me if he knows it makes no sense?</i>

404
00:24:14,797 --> 00:24:17,467
There's this too. Look here.

405
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:22,096
It says he's a clubbing addict
and that he only goes to gay clubs.

406
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,306
Gosh.

407
00:24:26,142 --> 00:24:27,685
What are you trying to pull?

408
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:29,938
He never goes clubbing.

409
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:33,524
-Why are you angry?
-Why are you showing me this?

410
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:36,277
-What do you mean?
-You must have a reason.

411
00:24:36,361 --> 00:24:37,612
You act like you're concerned,

412
00:24:37,695 --> 00:24:40,573
but you're actually saying,
"There's no smoke without fire."

413
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:43,201
It's not like you to be so emotional.

414
00:24:43,284 --> 00:24:45,536
I know, right? What's wrong with me?

415
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,997
I was a drill instructor
when I was in the military.

416
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:50,124
They called me Trooper
because I kept on going.

417
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,335
But don't get me wrong.
I never used violence.

418
00:24:52,418 --> 00:24:54,671
But now, I actually want to use violence.

419
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:58,716
Mr. Trooper,
I won't be joining you for dinner.

420
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,260
You do that.

421
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:08,142
How would you know
what your brother is up to?

422
00:25:08,726 --> 00:25:10,228
Why give me shit for telling you?

423
00:25:53,104 --> 00:25:56,065
I started my morning in a bad mood,
and I'm still upset.

424
00:25:56,858 --> 00:25:58,401
I want to end the day happily.

425
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:02,989
You should go eat something nice
with your manager.

426
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:05,616
Something with protein for the main dish
and a dessert,

427
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,868
then you'll feel better.

428
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:10,288
Aren't you interested
in doing that with me?

429
00:26:12,957 --> 00:26:14,500
Sorry, I have to go home.

430
00:26:14,584 --> 00:26:16,586
What's there that you have to rush home?

431
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,506
Hey, you do need to repay me. Do it today.

432
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,009
Today, I really can't. Cut me some slack.

433
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:25,261
But I'll repay you twice
to make up for today.

434
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:26,679
Are we good now?

435
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:28,973
Is Hye-jun waiting for you at your place?

436
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,102
Yes.

437
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,609
Does that mean
he even knows your door code?

438
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:46,991
I hope you can end your day
on a happy note.

439
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:48,242
You can make it so.

440
00:26:48,326 --> 00:26:50,286
Try to smile even if it's hard.

441
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,371
I'm off.

442
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,377
Can I come with you?

443
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,045
I miss Hye-jun too.

444
00:27:00,588 --> 00:27:02,006
I'm really sorry.

445
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,384
It'd be nice
for all of us to eat together,

446
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:06,427
but he's at my place. I don't feel--

447
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:08,805
Forget it. You're mean.

448
00:27:09,514 --> 00:27:11,140
I'll make it up to you later.

449
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:14,560
I'll drive you.
I'm sure you want to see him quickly.

450
00:27:16,187 --> 00:27:17,188
Thanks.

451
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,866
-I'm almost done.
-Take your time.

452
00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:34,247
HAE-HYO

453
00:27:39,252 --> 00:27:40,503
It's Hae-hyo.

454
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:41,796
Answer it.

455
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,389
-Hey, Hae-hyo.
-I want to drink.

456
00:27:51,472 --> 00:27:53,349
I'm still working.

457
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,518
Even you are rejecting me?

458
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:08,239
-Why are you stressed out?
-I'm just annoyed.

459
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:10,825
Why does everyone compare me with Hye-jun?

460
00:28:10,908 --> 00:28:12,410
That's nothing new.

461
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:14,787
It's always been that way.

462
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:17,290
Both of you used to model
and are actors now.

463
00:28:17,373 --> 00:28:18,583
And you two are close.

464
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:22,795
Really? But it didn't bother me back then.
Why does it annoy me so much now?

465
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:25,673
Because you were ahead of him then
and it's the other way now.

466
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,885
You're a true friend.

467
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,724
Was he also bothered by
how people compared him with me?

468
00:28:34,807 --> 00:28:38,144
No, he didn't have the time
because he was busy making ends meet.

469
00:28:57,455 --> 00:28:59,457
-You're home.
-Yes.

470
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,667
You must be hungry.
Wash your hands. Let's eat.

471
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:15,890
Be careful.

472
00:29:16,432 --> 00:29:17,475
I missed you.

473
00:29:19,894 --> 00:29:21,604
Me too. Aren't you hungry?

474
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:23,689
I am.

475
00:29:23,773 --> 00:29:24,774
Go wash your hands.

476
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:36,118
Let's eat.

477
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:42,250
A piece of meat.

478
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:44,627
Two chili pepper slices.

479
00:29:45,628 --> 00:29:46,796
One clove of garlic.

480
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:49,799
It's basic but it has a clean flavor.

481
00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:57,640
All right.

482
00:30:01,185 --> 00:30:02,144
Put the rice cake

483
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:08,609
on top of the meat.
And wrap it up like this and eat it.

484
00:30:11,988 --> 00:30:13,030
Gosh, this is good.

485
00:30:13,114 --> 00:30:15,157
-That looks too greasy.
-I like greasy food.

486
00:30:19,704 --> 00:30:22,957
I'm going to quit the beauty salon.

487
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:25,042
I picked a spot for my own salon.

488
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:29,046
It's in Mullae-dong. It's an up-and-coming
district with cheap rent.

489
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,633
And I decided not to sell this house.

490
00:30:32,717 --> 00:30:34,427
My dad is going to help me.

491
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:39,432
Do you approve?

492
00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:40,474
Yes.

493
00:30:41,058 --> 00:30:44,020
I'm glad you're not selling the house
and letting your dad help.

494
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:46,480
I wanted your approval the most
for that decision.

495
00:30:47,523 --> 00:30:49,650
I like helping other people,

496
00:30:49,734 --> 00:30:52,778
but I'm not good at letting
other people help me.

497
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:54,363
It's a type of deficiency, too.

498
00:30:55,573 --> 00:30:57,033
Deficiency beats overabundance.

499
00:30:57,658 --> 00:30:59,201
You keep improving.

500
00:31:00,036 --> 00:31:01,579
Let your dad help you.

501
00:31:03,956 --> 00:31:07,835
I like everything you did
to cook this meal for me,

502
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:12,173
except for one thing.

503
00:31:21,557 --> 00:31:22,892
I'll go and buy it now.

504
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:28,773
<i>-Hello, sir.
-Sir!</i>

505
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,210
That outfit looks great on you.

506
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:53,422
That's mine.
It's from a fashion show in New York.

507
00:31:55,424 --> 00:31:57,927
It looks too normal
for an outfit at a fashion show.

508
00:31:59,804 --> 00:32:01,013
<i>Son of a bitch?</i>

509
00:32:07,687 --> 00:32:09,021
What?

510
00:32:09,897 --> 00:32:11,273
Let's stop. I'm embarrassed.

511
00:32:17,113 --> 00:32:18,447
-Give it back.
-No.

512
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:19,907
-Give it back now.
-No.

513
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:21,325
I want to keep watching it.

514
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:22,618
-Don't watch it.
-Give me.

515
00:32:22,702 --> 00:32:23,869
-No.
-Give it back.

516
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,871
-Oh, no.
-Give it to me now.

517
00:32:25,955 --> 00:32:27,289
You're quite fast.

518
00:32:27,373 --> 00:32:28,624
-Of course.
-No.

519
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,959
MOM

520
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:35,297
-It's my mom.
-It's your mom.

521
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:37,967
What do we do?

522
00:32:43,998 --> 00:32:46,292
HYE-JUN

523
00:32:48,253 --> 00:32:49,796
He must be filming right now.

524
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:53,049
I wanted to see him.

525
00:33:02,434 --> 00:33:04,144
Your mom might be disappointed.

526
00:33:04,227 --> 00:33:07,480
It's been a while since you came to Seoul,
but you didn't see her first.

527
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:10,358
I'm sure she'll understand me.

528
00:33:12,068 --> 00:33:14,529
I told my mom about you.
She wants to meet you.

529
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:20,952
I have never met my boyfriend's mom.

530
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,376
You introduce your girlfriend

531
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,129
to your family when you date someone,
don't you?

532
00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:32,797
No, not really.

533
00:33:33,965 --> 00:33:36,259
I don't feel good about it either way.

534
00:33:36,342 --> 00:33:38,344
I'm happy that you're jealous.

535
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,893
How's it going these days?

536
00:33:45,685 --> 00:33:48,229
I can't imagine how it must feel.
How does it feel?

537
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:53,067
I'm anxious.

538
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:56,988
I look myself up online
multiple times a day.

539
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:03,661
Good for you that your name
pops up on the search engine.

540
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:05,371
Didn't you hear that I'm anxious?

541
00:34:06,706 --> 00:34:08,583
I don't want to address that part.

542
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:09,918
I'm anxious, too.

543
00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:13,546
What if my salon fails?

544
00:34:14,672 --> 00:34:16,758
You're anxious
because things are going well,

545
00:34:16,841 --> 00:34:18,927
but I'm anxious because I might fail.

546
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:22,305
There are different levels of anxiety.

547
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:26,184
You're always on a higher level.

548
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:31,606
Okay. I'll try to always look
on the bright side of everything.

549
00:34:33,024 --> 00:34:34,859
I like it that you understand me.

550
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:41,699
I think I should walk you back home.

551
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:43,243
Your mother is waiting for you.

552
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:44,828
She's probably asleep.

553
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:47,330
My family goes to sleep at 10 p.m.

554
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,317

I have to go to work now.

563

I'll get it for you. Leave it with me.

564
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:08,369
Gosh. I need it today.

565
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:11,915
You woke him up!

566
00:36:11,998 --> 00:36:14,959
Hey. Sleep some more. Okay?
Go back to sleep.

567
00:36:16,044 --> 00:36:17,462
Hey, go.

568
00:36:18,254 --> 00:36:19,172
-Go!
-Hye-jun!

569
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:20,173
Come on.

570
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:21,591
Hye-jun.

571
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:24,844
Wake up. Have breakfast
and go back to sleep.

572
00:36:24,928 --> 00:36:27,555
You're the best, Mom.
Hey, have breakfast first.

573
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:28,640
Wake up.

574
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:31,100
Wake up. Come on out.

575
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:44,072
"Park Su-yeon". Write her name, too.

576
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:50,536
-Do you know someone named Charlie Jung?
-Yes.

577
00:36:51,537 --> 00:36:53,790
I modeled for his brand a lot.

578
00:36:53,873 --> 00:36:55,291
He adored me.

579
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,294
What do you mean by "adore"?

580
00:36:58,378 --> 00:36:59,754
He saw that I have talent.

581
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:02,715
He gave me a lot of chances
to be in his shows.

582
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:03,800
I see.

583
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:05,885
Okay, so that's that.

584
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:09,180
Do you go clubbing?

585
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:11,474
I never have time to go clubbing.

586
00:37:11,557 --> 00:37:14,185
You startled me. Then, why were there
such comments online?

587
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:16,354
Did you go clubbing when you were a model?

588
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:19,148
Do you believe that? Don't you know him?

589
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,566
Mom, hit him one more time.

590
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,110
I didn't say I believed it.

591
00:37:22,193 --> 00:37:23,861
It's all made up.

592
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:26,114
They are jealous of his success.

593
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:28,700
You're his brother.
How can you believe such comments?

594
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:34,038
I didn't believe it.
I was worried when I heard about it.

595
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,874
You have to be careful.

596
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:40,420
Why would you say that?
He didn't do anything wrong.

597
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:44,841
Dad, you, too?
I can't even say anything in this house.

598
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:46,342
I was just curious.

599
00:37:46,426 --> 00:37:49,846
Why would you ask a question that
would upset him? He must be tired.

600
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:56,227
It's gone.

601
00:37:56,853 --> 00:37:58,813
My era has passed.

602
00:37:59,772 --> 00:38:03,526
The power dynamic in this house
is changing.

603
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:05,069
-Aren't you going to work?
-I am.

604
00:38:23,713 --> 00:38:24,922
HAN AE-SUK

605
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:28,676
Hello?

606
00:38:29,302 --> 00:38:30,136
It's me.

607
00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:32,346
<i>I know. What is this about?</i>

608
00:38:33,097 --> 00:38:35,391
I don't think I can work tomorrow.

609
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:37,852
<i>Can I work the day after tomorrow
or on the weekend?</i>

610
00:38:37,935 --> 00:38:38,853
What's wrong?

611
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:43,441
Hye-jun just came back to Seoul after
staying in the rural area for a shoot.

612
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:46,527
It looks like he lost some weight.
I want to feed him a good meal

613
00:38:46,611 --> 00:38:47,945
before he has to go back.

614
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:50,948
Okay. I'll see you in two days.

615
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:01,918
Mom. Do you have anything for my hangover?

616
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:04,462
I drank last night. I'm hungover.

617
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:08,758
Hye-jun must be
very busy shooting a drama.

618
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:10,593
Lucky you. You're enjoying yourself.

619
00:39:10,676 --> 00:39:12,970
Jin-u even carried you home last night.

620
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:16,057
Your father has been pushing me.

621
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,477
Mom, stop stealing from me.

622
00:39:20,853 --> 00:39:21,729
Steal what?

623
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:23,940
-My self-esteem.
-Gosh.

624
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:26,734
I should steal some more.

625
00:39:26,818 --> 00:39:28,820
If someone can take your self-esteem,

626
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:30,696
it's better that I steal it.

627
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,616
-Good morning.
-Morning.

628
00:39:34,492 --> 00:39:36,452
Order some food. Eat before you go.

629
00:39:36,536 --> 00:39:37,745
Okay.

630
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:43,543
Let's eat out.

631
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,755
-Hye-jun is in Seoul. Should we call him?
-No, let him be. He must be tired.

632
00:40:07,984 --> 00:40:08,901
Is he sleeping?

633
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:11,320
Yes. He's completely passed out.

634
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:13,364
No matter how exhausted he is,

635
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:15,408
he still has energy to see his girlfriend.

636
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:18,494
That's what makes him young.

637
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,957
-How jealous.
-Right.

638
00:40:23,749 --> 00:40:26,335
I'm jealous of Jeong-ha.
although I haven't met her yet.

639
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:30,631
Is there anything you want to eat?
I'm going grocery shopping.

640
00:40:31,257 --> 00:40:32,758
I'll buy some herbal tonics, too.

641
00:40:34,343 --> 00:40:36,512
I'm glad there are
so many things to do for him.

642
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:42,393
Hello. I'm here for a delivery.

643
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:45,146
-Who ordered it?
-I did.

644
00:40:46,022 --> 00:40:47,481
-Thank you.
-Enjoy your food.

645
00:40:48,149 --> 00:40:50,234
It's my treat to celebrate my resignation.

646
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:52,236
I'll put it in the lounge. Have some food.

647
00:40:53,487 --> 00:40:55,865
-Thank you. It looks delicious.
-Enjoy.

648
00:41:00,536 --> 00:41:03,039
This is good. Thank you.

649
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,379
The person I want to thank the most
before quitting is Jin-ju.

650
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:18,137
I did train her to be tough.

651
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,598
I'm sorry.

652
00:41:23,226 --> 00:41:25,311
Was it because you were training her?

653
00:41:25,394 --> 00:41:28,105
Of course.
How can I steal male clients from her?

654
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,650
You knew about that.

655
00:41:31,484 --> 00:41:34,612
Why would they come to me
when Jin-ju is prettier?

656
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:39,367
That's true.

657
00:41:41,452 --> 00:41:43,037
-Have some.
-Thank you.

658
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,293
<i>"If Park Jin-ju</i>

659
00:41:49,377 --> 00:41:54,131

660
00:41:54,215 --> 00:41:56,175
"I, Park Jin-ju,

00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:02,306
tried to kick An Jeong-ha

662
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,976
"…for spreading a rumor

663
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:09,647
that I stole her male clients
to kick An Jeong-ha out--"

664
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,315
Don't write that in such detail.

665
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:12,775
It's embarrassing.

666
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:16,404
Jin-ju, so you do feel embarrassed?

667
00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:19,323
This is insulting. I won't write it.

668
00:42:19,824 --> 00:42:21,867
I won't do it, either.
Let's forget about it.

669
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:23,327
Damn it.

670
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:27,164
Can you just write about the video?

671
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,173
-"For nitpicking--"
-Don't write that, either.

673
00:42:49,895 --> 00:42:51,188

-Hye-jun!

675

Oh, Hye-jun.

678
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:00,906
Stop it.

679
00:43:04,285 --> 00:43:05,786
You're not Yi Geon.

680
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:08,205
No! You're not Geon.

681
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:11,000
Bring back Geon.
Hye-jun, please bring him back!

682
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:12,209
Stop it.

683
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:15,254
Okay.

684
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:19,383
Here's my Geon!

685
00:43:20,426 --> 00:43:22,511

It's Min-jae.

688
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:35,775
-Hey, Min-jae.
-Hye-jun.

689
00:43:36,442 --> 00:43:38,944
I told them you'd host
the end of the year awards.

690
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:40,780
You've been

691
00:43:41,405 --> 00:43:43,532
nominated as the Best Male Actor.

692
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:47,578
-Really?
<i>-Yes, really.</i>

693
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,915
<i>Congratulations. I have to go home now.</i>

694
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:56,504
What is it?

695
00:44:08,516 --> 00:44:10,267
I've been nominated for Best Male Actor.

696
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:12,895
And I'm the host.

697
00:44:12,978 --> 00:44:14,897
You're amazing!

698
00:44:15,481 --> 00:44:16,816
You really became a star!

699
00:44:19,068 --> 00:44:20,236
This doesn't feel real.

700
00:44:21,278 --> 00:44:23,531
It will be real
when the awards ceremony starts.

701
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:43,152
-Sir, this way.
-This way?

702
00:45:43,235 --> 00:45:44,445
Yes.

703
00:45:45,196 --> 00:45:47,406
Ms. Han, you can sit next to Mr. Sa.

704
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:49,325
I want to sit with her. You go in.

705
00:45:49,408 --> 00:45:50,534
Sure.

706
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,538
Gosh.

707
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:58,167
Where's Hye-jun?

708
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,794
He's reading the script.
He should be done by now.

709
00:46:00,878 --> 00:46:03,172
I see. There's a script.

710
00:46:03,255 --> 00:46:05,299
Everything on TV comes with a script.

711
00:46:05,382 --> 00:46:06,675
How do you know that?

712
00:46:06,759 --> 00:46:08,552
You can look it up online.

713
00:46:09,303 --> 00:46:11,138
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

714
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:33,661
What's all the fuss?
It's only the Rookie of the Year.

715
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,622
He accused me of stealing his self-esteem.

716
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:38,499
So today, I'll boost it.

717
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:44,546
I want you to give him compliments today.

718
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,340
You'll make him soft.

719
00:46:46,423 --> 00:46:48,425
I raised him to be gentle and bright.

720
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:50,177
People like that.

721
00:46:50,261 --> 00:46:52,471
He needs to be liked to be successful.

722
00:46:52,554 --> 00:46:55,391
You don't like Mr. Kim
because he's all twisted inside.

723
00:46:55,474 --> 00:46:57,059
Don't compare Hae-hyo to him.

724
00:46:57,142 --> 00:47:00,562
Mr. Kim and your older brother have
a similar personality.

725
00:47:00,646 --> 00:47:02,439
Had we raised Hae-hyo wrong,

726
00:47:02,523 --> 00:47:04,358
he could have turned out like him.

727
00:47:04,441 --> 00:47:06,443
Why bring him up? It's pissing me off.

728
00:47:08,445 --> 00:47:10,239
-Can't we go out?
-No.

729
00:47:10,781 --> 00:47:14,576
We should celebrate as a family
when something good has happened.

730
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,203
That's our family rule.

731
00:47:17,538 --> 00:47:19,957
<i>You look handsome. You look hot!</i>

732
00:47:20,582 --> 00:47:22,376
<i>-You look great!
-Over here.</i>

733
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:25,296
<i>-This way.
-Over here!</i>

734
00:47:30,884 --> 00:47:33,012
Does my hair look too much?

735
00:47:33,095 --> 00:47:34,346
No, it looks fine.

736
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:39,893
Ms. An, you must forget all about me
when you work on Hae-hyo.

737
00:47:39,977 --> 00:47:41,395
Isn't that only right?

738
00:47:41,478 --> 00:47:44,606
I was the one to discover Ms. An
and her talent as a makeup artist.

739
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:47,484
That's not true. I introduced you to her.

740
00:47:47,568 --> 00:47:49,278
I lost her to you because of money.

741
00:47:51,196 --> 00:47:52,614
There you go again.

742
00:47:52,698 --> 00:47:54,366
Why don't you date each other?

743
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,827
I don't want to fall victim
to your bickering.

744
00:47:59,371 --> 00:48:01,332
Min-su is presenting the Best Actor Award.

745
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:02,666
Will he leave right away?

746
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,835
I should talk to Min-jae about it.

747
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:07,629
If you win, it will be from Min-su.
Lucky you.

748
00:48:08,464 --> 00:48:09,840
I doubt that I'll win.

749
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:11,050
Hae-hyo.

750
00:48:13,635 --> 00:48:14,803
There you are.

751
00:48:16,013 --> 00:48:17,848
You're going to win Rookie of the Year.

752
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:20,142
There are strong candidates.

753
00:48:20,225 --> 00:48:23,270
But I'm sure you'll win.
<i>Catch</i> had the highest ratings

754
00:48:23,354 --> 00:48:24,980
compared to your competitor's.

755
00:48:25,064 --> 00:48:27,191
Then Hye-jun will win
the Best Actor Award.

756
00:48:27,691 --> 00:48:29,860
His drama had the highest ratings
among them.

757
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:33,030
Come on. He said something nice to you.
Return the favor.

758
00:48:33,113 --> 00:48:35,949
Do-ha did a great job in that drama.
You saw it yourself.

759
00:48:36,033 --> 00:48:38,869
Let them talk.
It's bad manners to butt in.

760
00:48:39,495 --> 00:48:41,372
Hello. I said hello to you.

761
00:48:41,455 --> 00:48:43,540
I was taught a good manager
always says hello.

762
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:47,211
Right. You must be so happy
to see Hye-jun's career take off.

763
00:48:47,836 --> 00:48:51,507
You know, there's something called
the beginner's luck,

764
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:54,009
so I can't say
whether he'll keep doing well.

765
00:48:55,511 --> 00:48:58,597
But he was with you
when he was just a beginner.

766
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:01,433
I need to talk to Hye-jun.

767
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:20,494
What's going on?

768
00:49:22,621 --> 00:49:25,582
I thought he'd come right on time.
But he's already here.

769
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:27,084
He's in the dressing room.

770
00:49:29,962 --> 00:49:31,004
Hurry.

771
00:49:39,263 --> 00:49:40,597
-Hi.
-Hye-jun!

772
00:49:40,681 --> 00:49:42,015
It's been so long.

773
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:44,309
I heard you're hosting.

774
00:49:44,393 --> 00:49:45,561
I came by to say hello.

775
00:49:46,145 --> 00:49:48,313
Even now, you're still a man with manners.

776
00:49:48,397 --> 00:49:50,190
I've known you since you were this tall.

777
00:49:50,274 --> 00:49:52,526
I bet he's still the same height.

778
00:49:55,446 --> 00:49:57,990
My manager. She'd like your autograph.

779
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:00,701
Come on.

780
00:50:01,827 --> 00:50:03,579
This isn't like her at all.

781
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:06,415
I'm a huge fan, you see.

782
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:09,418
I watched all of your TV shows and movies.

783
00:50:10,169 --> 00:50:12,629
-Thank you.
-I'm Lee Min-jae.

784
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:15,132
Please make sure to include my name.

785
00:50:15,883 --> 00:50:16,925
Sure.

786
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:22,222
Are you winning an award today?

787
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:24,641
-I don't know.
-They won't tell us.

788
00:50:24,725 --> 00:50:26,560
Why won't they tell him
when he's the host?

789
00:50:26,643 --> 00:50:28,145
Must they be so close-minded?

790
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:30,856
I see. So this is how she's really like.

791
00:50:30,939 --> 00:50:32,441
Actually, she's worse than this.

792
00:50:33,025 --> 00:50:35,110
-Here you go.
-Thank you!

793
00:50:36,153 --> 00:50:37,571
Can we get together afterward?

794
00:50:37,654 --> 00:50:39,198
Hae-hyo wants to see you too.

795
00:50:39,281 --> 00:50:41,617
I hear he's been nominated
for Rookie of the Year.

796
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,660
What will you do for me if you both win?

797
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:45,996
Your wish will be our command.

798
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,581
Count me in as well.

799
00:50:47,664 --> 00:50:49,041
-That's enough.
-Got it.

800
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:51,460
It was nice meeting you.

801
00:50:52,169 --> 00:50:54,296
Thank you. I'll keep this with me forever.

802
00:50:54,379 --> 00:50:55,839
It was a pleasure.

803
00:50:55,923 --> 00:50:57,716
-Thank you.
-Bye.

804
00:50:57,799 --> 00:50:59,468
-I'll see you, then.
-Sure.

805
00:50:59,551 --> 00:51:00,844
-Thank you.
-Sure thing.

806
00:51:00,928 --> 00:51:02,054
-Have a good day.
-Sure.

807
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:04,014
-Thank you.
-Bye.

808
00:51:07,726 --> 00:51:08,936
She sure is hectic.

809
00:51:10,982 --> 00:51:11,941
Tae-su.

810
00:51:12,733 --> 00:51:14,485
See if I'm winning an award today.

811
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:16,153
If not, I'm going home.

812
00:51:18,823 --> 00:51:20,825
There's a 90 percent chance you'll win.

813
00:51:20,908 --> 00:51:23,327
It doesn't matter
if Hye-jun's a rising star.

814
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:25,329
They won't give him Best Actor.

815
00:51:25,413 --> 00:51:27,039
He hasn't even won Rookie of the Year.

816
00:51:27,123 --> 00:51:30,126
The 2019 OVN Drama Awards.

817
00:51:30,209 --> 00:51:33,045
The Best Male Actor
for the miniseries category goes to…

818
00:51:33,546 --> 00:51:35,548
OVN DRAMA AWARDS
MINISERIES, BEST MALE ACTOR

819
00:51:39,468 --> 00:51:41,095
I see. It's him.

820
00:51:42,597 --> 00:51:44,891
Sa Hye-jun, <i>The King Returns</i>.
Congratulations.

821
00:52:23,971 --> 00:52:24,972
Thank you.

822
00:52:25,514 --> 00:52:26,849
Who knew this day would come?

823
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:31,520
Up until just a year ago,

824
00:52:32,021 --> 00:52:34,982
I was an unknown aspiring actor
who had multiple part-time jobs.

825
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:39,737
My grandfather encouraged
and supported me all through those years.

826
00:52:41,989 --> 00:52:43,282
Thank you, Grandpa.

827
00:52:46,744 --> 00:52:49,246
And Mom, I love you.

828
00:52:55,795 --> 00:52:58,798
The same goes to my fan club,
Hye-jun All the Way.

829
00:53:02,551 --> 00:53:06,013
I will not forget everyone
who has stuck by me

830
00:53:06,097 --> 00:53:07,682
since my modeling days.

831
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:09,809
Last but not least,

832
00:53:11,018 --> 00:53:13,020
all the members of Hye-jun All the Way.

833
00:53:15,982 --> 00:53:17,274
Thank you.

834
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,152
SA HYE-JUN

835
00:53:30,663 --> 00:53:33,457
The wine bottle has been popped open,

836
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,793
so let's enjoy a glass.

837
00:53:45,886 --> 00:53:48,723
Should I try calling Hae-hyo again?

838
00:53:48,806 --> 00:53:50,391
But he's not answering.

839
00:53:52,226 --> 00:53:53,352
Leave him be.

840
00:54:12,913 --> 00:54:15,207
Just skip to the Best Actor like Hye-jun.

841
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:19,003
Who cares about winning
Rookie of the Year anyway?

842
00:54:21,297 --> 00:54:22,465
You're absolutely right.

843
00:54:23,632 --> 00:54:25,259
I'll follow in his footsteps.

844
00:54:25,342 --> 00:54:27,470
Let's hurry out there for a photo.

845
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:43,861
Min-su can stand in the center.

846
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:46,572
You two dummies can stand on either side.

847
00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:49,241
Are you sure about this?

848
00:54:50,868 --> 00:54:52,787
-What does that make you then?
-Me?

849
00:54:54,371 --> 00:54:56,248
A dummy who has two dummies as friends.

850
00:54:57,374 --> 00:54:59,543
I'm shy around people, but like him.

851
00:55:00,169 --> 00:55:01,504
Thanks, Min-su.

852
00:55:04,173 --> 00:55:06,759
I'd love to be in this photo too.

853
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,969
Come on, then.

854
00:55:10,012 --> 00:55:11,138
Min-jae?

855
00:55:16,102 --> 00:55:18,104
-Join us.
-Just press this.

856
00:55:18,896 --> 00:55:20,523
-Got it.
-Thanks. Nice!

857
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,442
I'd love to join you guys too.

858
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:25,444
Count before you shoot.

859
00:55:27,321 --> 00:55:29,615
One, two, three.

860
00:55:37,706 --> 00:55:39,708
We should hurry. Your parents are waiting.

861
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:40,960
Didn't they go ahead?

862
00:55:41,043 --> 00:55:43,629
My mom insisted on seeing you.

863
00:55:43,712 --> 00:55:45,548
I think I should hurry home.

864
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:47,591
You should. Hae-na's worried about you.

865
00:55:48,217 --> 00:55:49,051
Did she call you?

866
00:55:53,514 --> 00:55:55,349
Is it odd for us to be in contact?

867
00:55:55,933 --> 00:55:57,226
No. Did I say it was?

868
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:00,604
It's fine either way. Let's go.

869
00:56:02,898 --> 00:56:04,108
They're over here.

870
00:56:04,191 --> 00:56:05,484
I'm sorry for the wait.

871
00:56:08,154 --> 00:56:10,447
Hye-jun, you were amazing today.

872
00:56:10,531 --> 00:56:11,824
I'm in your fan club too

873
00:56:11,907 --> 00:56:14,243
and we're all thrilled
that you mentioned us.

874
00:56:15,202 --> 00:56:17,580
How can you be so calm on stage?

875
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,081
Aren't you hungry?

876
00:56:19,165 --> 00:56:21,125
I am now, that I'm less nervous.

877
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:24,003
I already booked a restaurant,
so let's head there.

878
00:56:24,086 --> 00:56:27,089
-Chi-yeong will lead the way.
-Over here.

879
00:56:27,173 --> 00:56:28,966
Well, it's this way.

880
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,928
Min-jae, have you seen Jeong-ha?

881
00:56:36,515 --> 00:56:38,100
I'm so out of it today.

882
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:41,729
Let's go.

883
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:52,823
Pay me back twofold.

884
00:56:54,575 --> 00:56:56,035
Will you say no again?

885
00:56:58,287 --> 00:57:00,664
My gosh. Yes, thank you so much.

886
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:03,209
Of course. We'll meet up soon.

887
00:57:04,335 --> 00:57:08,214
10 MISSED CALLS

888
00:57:08,297 --> 00:57:10,257
JEONG-HA: 1, JI-A: 2, CHARLIE: 1

889
00:57:15,596 --> 00:57:18,098
JEONG-HA

890
00:58:21,537 --> 00:58:23,122
INCOMING CALL
DO-HA

891
00:58:27,334 --> 00:58:28,544
-What is it?
-Hey.

892
00:58:29,253 --> 00:58:30,671
Come on over, will you?

893
00:58:31,297 --> 00:58:32,256
Join me for drinks.

894
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,508
<i>We were both shitted on today.</i>

895
00:58:34,592 --> 00:58:35,801
I'm with a friend.

896
00:58:36,385 --> 00:58:38,012
Are you with Sa Hye-jun?

897
00:58:38,637 --> 00:58:40,556
<i>Have you no pride?</i>

898
00:58:41,307 --> 00:58:42,391
You sound wasted.

899
00:58:42,474 --> 00:58:45,185
Don't pretend to be high and mighty.

900
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:48,606
<i>I know that you of all people
don't want him to be successful,</i>

901
00:58:48,689 --> 00:58:49,857
<i>so cut the crap!</i>

902
00:58:51,942 --> 00:58:53,319
He said I'm high and mighty.

903
00:58:56,155 --> 00:58:59,033
Meanwhile, my mom tells me
I have no backbone and I'm stagnant.

904
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,327
Before I left home today, she said

905
00:59:02,244 --> 00:59:03,621
Rookie of the Year is nothing

906
00:59:03,704 --> 00:59:05,789
compared to Hye-jun being nominated
for Best Actor.

907
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:10,419
But I failed to even win
that crappy award.

908
00:59:15,549 --> 00:59:16,925
Jeez, I'm hungry.

909
00:59:19,011 --> 00:59:20,763
Way to cut off my serious ranting.

910
00:59:23,223 --> 00:59:24,266
So what would you like?

911
00:59:43,911 --> 00:59:45,287
You were hungry too.

912
00:59:48,248 --> 00:59:50,167
Slow down, will you?

913
00:59:55,923 --> 00:59:56,965
What's wrong?

914
01:00:29,206 --> 01:00:30,666
You should see a doctor.

915
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:33,961
I throw up when I'm stressed.

916
01:00:34,044 --> 01:00:36,964
-I have stomach issues.
-You should have passed on dinner then.

917
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:41,051
As if I could say no to you.

918
01:01:19,131 --> 01:01:20,799
I wanted Rookie of the Year badly.

919
01:01:22,843 --> 01:01:25,929
Other awards you can win multiple times,

920
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:27,681
but not Rookie of the Year.

921
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,855
I hate being compared to Hye-jun.

922
01:01:46,575 --> 01:01:49,161
SA HYE-JUN WORTHY OF BEST ACTOR AWARD

923
01:01:57,002 --> 01:02:00,088
A GAY DESIGNER WAS HIS SUGAR DADDY
WHEN HE WAS A MODEL

924
01:02:02,508 --> 01:02:05,677
SA HYE-JUN DATED CHARLIE JUNG
AND WAS HIS SUGAR BABY

925
01:02:06,595 --> 01:02:07,930
This will be a tough choice.

926
01:02:09,723 --> 01:02:11,016
I'll just get one of them.

927
01:02:12,392 --> 01:02:14,228
Actually, I'll get them both.

928
01:02:24,738 --> 01:02:25,697
TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE

929
01:02:28,617 --> 01:02:30,285
SA HYE-JUN DATED CHARLIE JUNG

930
01:02:30,369 --> 01:02:32,287
He does this on all the articles.

931
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:33,789
He must be like a stalker.

932
01:02:42,297 --> 01:02:44,842
I BET YOU WERE DUMPED BY CHARLIE JUNG

933
01:02:50,097 --> 01:02:50,973
Well done.

934
01:02:52,224 --> 01:02:54,434
Hye-jun, you did great today.

935
01:02:55,686 --> 01:02:57,020
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

936
01:02:57,104 --> 01:02:59,022
-Father, how about some water?
-Oh, yes.

937
01:02:59,606 --> 01:03:01,275
-Goodness.
-Me too.

938
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:05,529
-You're home.
-Hey.

939
01:03:05,612 --> 01:03:07,906
Didn't you go out with friends?
When did you get here?

940
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:09,950
It would've been nice to have you there.

941
01:03:10,492 --> 01:03:12,286
Do you know what Hye-jun said?

942
01:03:12,369 --> 01:03:14,621
He thanked his grandpa.

943
01:03:14,705 --> 01:03:16,123
He also said he loved his mom.

944
01:03:16,623 --> 01:03:17,749
I watched the live show.

945
01:03:19,293 --> 01:03:20,919
You left out Dad though.

946
01:03:23,547 --> 01:03:26,049
Addressing me is the same
as addressing him.

947
01:03:27,885 --> 01:03:30,679
-He didn't mention you either.
-But I wasn't there.

948
01:03:31,346 --> 01:03:34,182
Tell us right now.
Are you grateful or not?

949
01:03:34,266 --> 01:03:35,767
Why didn't you say it on stage?

950
01:03:37,436 --> 01:03:39,062
Must you be so childish?

951
01:03:39,855 --> 01:03:41,523
He's getting up because he's guilty.

952
01:03:41,607 --> 01:03:45,235
Must you be like this on a good day?

953
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:46,194
I know Dad.

954
01:03:46,945 --> 01:03:49,031
I'm pretty sure he's upset.

955
01:03:51,742 --> 01:03:54,036
-Why are you getting up?
-To rest in my room.

956
01:03:55,203 --> 01:03:57,331
Dinner must've been salty today.

957
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:02,669
-Unbelievable.
-But he didn't.

958
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,519
Hye-jun didn't leave you out
because he hates you.

959
01:04:21,146 --> 01:04:23,690
So he hates me now?

960
01:04:23,774 --> 01:04:25,817
Was I that mean to him?

961
01:04:25,901 --> 01:04:27,444
Of course not.

962
01:04:29,863 --> 01:04:32,115
Are you happy
to hear him say he loves you?

963
01:04:33,617 --> 01:04:37,329
How could he have not mentioned
his gratitude toward me?

964
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:41,541
Hearing him say he loves me
put me on cloud nine.

965
01:04:43,085 --> 01:04:44,962
Talk about a surge of emotions.

966
01:04:45,754 --> 01:04:48,215
He loves me even though
I barely did anything for him.

967
01:04:49,216 --> 01:04:53,011
Fighting through all the hardships
of our marriage finally paid off.

968
01:04:54,805 --> 01:04:58,433
Nothing in this life is better
than seeing our son succeed.

969
01:05:48,942 --> 01:05:50,652
YOU HAVE A TEXT FROM CHARLIE JUNG

970
01:05:59,411 --> 01:06:00,537
MONTHLY SCHEDULE

971
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:01,788
Over here, please.

972
01:06:02,497 --> 01:06:03,498
Right.

973
01:06:04,082 --> 01:06:05,417
That goes over there.

974
01:06:06,209 --> 01:06:08,253
-Let me take that.
-Look at all these gifts.

975
01:06:14,634 --> 01:06:15,886
I'll take that.

976
01:06:18,638 --> 01:06:19,514
A signature?

977
01:06:21,308 --> 01:06:22,851
Thank you so much.

978
01:06:22,934 --> 01:06:24,102
Thank you.

979
01:06:29,107 --> 01:06:31,443
He made it big. My Hye-jun is a star!

980
01:06:32,027 --> 01:06:34,613
He'll be on a path to glory now.

981
01:06:34,696 --> 01:06:36,364
Let's not get too hasty.

982
01:06:36,448 --> 01:06:38,325
I'm not getting hasty, it's a fact.

983
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:43,038
Let's see where
our Superstar Sa currently is.

984
01:06:49,336 --> 01:06:51,755
-Where are you?
-The parking lot.

985
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:53,340
I got held up at the gym.

986
01:06:54,049 --> 01:06:56,176
Did you ask the director
when we're shooting again?

987
01:06:56,259 --> 01:06:59,262
<i>It's next month.
Don't be such a workaholic.</i>

988
01:06:59,888 --> 01:07:00,972
I like working.

989
01:07:01,723 --> 01:07:03,892
I'm going to make up for my lost time.

990
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,604
I'll be right up.

991
01:07:22,911 --> 01:07:23,912
Hello?

992
01:07:23,995 --> 01:07:26,456
<i>Yes, hello. This is Sergeant Lee Jin-yeong</i>

993
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:29,459
<i>of the Criminal Investigation Division
at Gangnam Police Station.</i>

994
01:07:30,043 --> 01:07:31,670
<i>Is this Mr. Sa Hye-jun?</i>

995
01:07:33,463 --> 01:07:35,006
Yes, speaking.

996
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,592
<i>I called to ask you to come by the station</i>

997
01:07:37,676 --> 01:07:39,845
<i>to give us a statement</i>

998
01:07:39,928 --> 01:07:42,973
<i>regarding the death of Mr. Charlie Jung.</i>

999
01:07:49,354 --> 01:07:51,231
Well-known fashion designer Charlie Jung

1000
01:07:51,314 --> 01:07:53,817
was found dead this morning.

1001
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:57,320
<i>The police are investigating
the cause of his death</i>

1002
01:07:57,404 --> 01:07:59,573
<i>on the premise of it
likely being a suicide.</i>

01:08:35,192 --> 01:08:37,319

01:09:24,407 --> 01:09:28,119
I've thought about this,
but I like "An Jeong-Ha Studio" the best.

<i>Whether Hye-jun buys a house or not</i>

1010
01:09:30,288 --> 01:09:32,207
is none of our business.

1011
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:33,750
I'll pay back your debt.

1012
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:37,128
No. It's not true.
You can't write articles on that.

1013
01:09:37,212 --> 01:09:40,924
Hye-jun apparently likes men.

1014
01:09:41,007 --> 01:09:42,133
We should sue him.

1015
01:09:42,217 --> 01:09:46,596
The people you love
want to share your burden with you.

1016
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,516
Don't you realize there are people
who want to see you fail?
