It's a glioblastoma.

You have multifocal glioblastomas.

They are the cause of your dizziness...

Okay.

00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:01,819
No, I don't.

How many days will it take to do the biopsy?

16

It will take at least a week.

That won't work.

19
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,079
Then, I can't.

20
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:29,079
You can't do a biopsy?

21
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,149
No.

22
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:33,220
I already used some of my vacation days.

23

So I can't take a week off from work.

24

Shouldn't you put your health before your work?

25
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,860
I'm not sure.

26

Getting a biopsy can be risky enough.

34
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:09,160
- It's risky?
- Yes.

35
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:12,130
Will I die?

36
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,660

Don't worry. When the time is right, you'll get it back.

161
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,350
Some don't even get to sprout.

162
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,590
And some bloom late.

163
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,560
Some wilt away quickly.

164
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,029
Some turn out to be medicinal, and some, poisonous.

165
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,860
And some plants will kill everything around them.

166
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,169

Pull them out. Plant only the good ones.

168
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,800
And cherish some plants more than the others.

169
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:45,039
A garden doesn't belong to a gardener.

170
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,779
Then what about me?

171
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:52,580
What is my position in your garden?

172
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,850
You are a butterfly.

173
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,820
For the flowers in my garden.

174
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,190
Until when?

175
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:02,060
Forever.

176
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:09,029
You are way too cruel. Especially to a birthday boy.

177
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,600
Birthday? You think you're human?

178
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:16,440
Have you ever been born? Or human for that matter?

179
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,310
Go.

180
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,180
Go and become someone's wish.

181
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,619
Today is the only day that's possible.

182
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,860
Even my birthday isn't for me.

183
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,820
For humans.

184
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,230
Darn those flowers.

185
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,129
It's about time they wilt away.

186
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:58,110
A bus will arrive shortly.

188
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:48,629
(Boyfriend)

189
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:57,169
- Hey, sweetie.
- Are you busy?

190
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,009
No. I'm...

191
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,210
I'm outside. I was meeting up with a writer.

192
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,480
Really? Then can we meet now?

193
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,580
Now?

194
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,810
I need to see you right now.

195
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:09,950
What's wrong?

196
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,649
Let's talk in person.

197
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:13,450
Come to that cafe. Okay?

198
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:15,289
Hey...

199
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,159
Gosh.

200
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,759
- She splashed water on that girl.
- No way.

201
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:25,930
As you can see, this is all I can do because I'm pregnant.

202
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:34,869
Can you explain...

203
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:36,980
this?

204
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,450
You're the one who needs to explain things to me.

205
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:40,110
You're the mistress.

206
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,649
You expect me, his wife, to explain what happened?

207
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:43,220
Where did you learn your manners?

208
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:50,090
I see. That's what happened.

209
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Fine.

210
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:57,060
That explains everything.

211
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,129
I heard that you met here for the first time.

212
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:02,800
Did you look through his phone?

213
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
You don't think I didn't?

214
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,039
Then you must have seen how he never called me on weekends...

215
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,409
and answered my calls at night.

216
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,940
Whenever I couldn't reach him, he told me his phone died,

217
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,009
it was on silent mode, and he was working.

218
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:14,649
You must've read those texts then.

219
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,279
That always bothered me.

220
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,789
I knew something was off, but...

221
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,159
Now, this explains everything.

222
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,759
Are you telling me you didn't know he was married?

223
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,889
Yes. I didn't.

224
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:29,800
You didn't know after dating him for three months?

225
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,529
Stop lying to me!

226
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:34,269
You didn't know your husband was cheating on you for three months.

227
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:35,369
Hey!

228
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,769
So you're saying you didn't do anything wrong?

229
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,480
Is that it?

230
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:44,739
I guess so.

231
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:47,050
"I guess so"? You're unbelievable.

232
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,720
Then whom should I splash water on?

233
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,800
You can at least take it out on me.

234
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,600
But I can't even take it out on you.

235
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,700
It's all that jerk's fault. What should I do?

236
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,940
Why are you telling me your sob story?

237
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,470
Right.

238
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,869
I shouldn't say that to you.

239
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,249
So...

240
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,050
you can keep blaming me.

241
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:28,690
What?

242
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,090
Pretend that your gentle, innocent husband...

243
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,889
was deceived by an awful woman and almost ruined his life.

244
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,460
Be it 10 or 50 years.

245
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,100
Live happily with that cheater for a long time.

246
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,139
That will be better for your child too.

247
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,350
- Are you okay?
- Gosh.

248
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,649
- Oh, no.
- I'm not okay.

249
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,389
- Should you go to a hospital?
- Are you okay?

250
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,090
Taxi! Right here!

251
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:06,759
Right here. Yes.

252
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:09,529
Wait. Be careful.

253
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,700
Be careful.

254
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:16,340
Sir, drive us to a nearby hospital with OBGYNs.

255
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,520
The mother is okay.

256
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:36,290
This happens frequently when mothers are stressed.

257
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,929
- You don't have to worry.
- Okay.

258
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:40,090
Are you her guardian?

259
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:42,429
No.

260
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,869
She's just a mutual friend. Something like that.

261
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,240
Do you know her guardian's number?

262
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:54,209
Yes.

264
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:04,520
Then can you fill this out for me?

270

We still need to talk.

271
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,830
Let's talk once you feel better.

272
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,830
I knew something was off too.

273
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,869
His excuses didn't make sense.

274
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,540
But I wanted to blame it on you...

275
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,310
because I thought if I did that, it might be your fault.

276
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,280
What I told you earlier...

277
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,919
I meant it when I told you to blame it on me.

278
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,689
Blame me for it because...

279
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,500
I'll die in three months.

280
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,570
I was wondering who's going to hear this news first.

281
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,709
I didn't know that I would be telling you that in this context.

282
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:40,209
Well, I didn't know that I was terminally ill.

283
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,580
Are you serious?

284
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,619
I meant everything I said at the cafe and here.

285
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:47,649
So...

286
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,719
you don't have to worry.

287
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:53,929
And...

288
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:58,629
I sincerely hope you two will have a long and happy life.

289

Hey, do you think work is a joke?

291
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,459
You left to meet with the writer hours ago.

292
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:03,959
Why did you come back so late?

293
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:06,729
You should have just gone home then. Why come back here?

294
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,240

- That's it?

Are you acting out?

298
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,979
You should just quit. Why don't you quit your job?

299
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:23,219
You must think earning money is easy.

300

Kids these days don't have any work ethics.

301
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,820
I wasn't feeling well.

302
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,459
The writer told me to get a scan since I was already at the hospital.

303
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:35,090
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,929
This is why I can't hire women.

305
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:40,399
They always complain that they aren't feeling well.

306
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,000
They are like broken machines.

307
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,270
At least, I can get those machines fixed.

308
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,169
Gosh. I can't even get her fixed.

309
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,510
I don't feel well, either.

310
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,679
You know,

311
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,850
I have rhinitis and a herniated disk.

312
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,050
I feel like I'm dying too.

313

As you can see, this is all I can do...

316
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:11,330
- because I'm pregnant.
- What?

317
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,600
- Hey, isn't that you?
- Can you explain...

318
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,000
- What?
- this?

319

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,929
Hey!

334
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:48,070
- What are you doing?
- So what if that's me?

335
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,669
What are you going to do then?

336
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,909
Did you...

337
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,709
just yell at me?

338
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,149
You think I'm a joke, right?

339
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:03,179
What?

340
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,790
Of course. Even I think I'm a joke.

341
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,290
Why is everyone torturing me today?

342
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,229
I'll take a day off today.

343
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,429
I will.

344
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,260
I already don't have a lot of vacation days left,

345
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,669
so I'll use one today.

346
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,139
You...

347
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,840
What...

348
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:30,740
That's her in the video.

349
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:32,550
She said no, so it must not be her.

350
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:34,679
You think so? That's not her?

351
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:37,219
Are my eyes going bad?

Once it rains, all the ginkgo leaves will fall.

353

- Autumn is so short.
- Right.

Girls like her must be punished.

I hope she gets sick and dies.

People like her rot our society.

I'm at Jeju Island with my friends.

410
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:17,389
And we just scratched the car we rented.

411
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:19,389
- Hey.
- I told them earlier...

412
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:21,030
that we should get expensive insurance.

413
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,530
But Sang Geun kept saying it'll be fine.

I called you because it's urgent.

Hey, do you really have to do this today?

My gosh, it's that time of year already?

428
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:58,929
I was in the army last year.

429

Not knowing how to cry...

434
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:59,790
has been a habit of mine for a long time.

435
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:17,070
When I was 10,

436
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:20,310
I learned how to swallow my tears.

437
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,409
I wonder where all those tears...

438
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:31,719
ended up going.

439
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,080
Now I finally get it.

440
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,300
They're our family, so someone in the family should raise them.

441
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,399
It's not like you're going to volunteer.

442
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,469
It's not easy to raise someone else's children.

443
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:25,639
She has a point.

444
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,740
They shouldn't grow up walking on eggshells.

445
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,409
Why don't we just send them to an orphanage...

446
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:31,840
They'll hear you.

447
00:32:49,729 --> 00:32:52,260
I wasn't able to cry ever since that day.

448
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,169
And all those tears must've...

449
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,869
turned into a lump and took place somewhere in my brain.

450
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,550
Hey, Aunt.

451
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,619
Today's the anniversary of your parents' death, right?

452
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,020
- Did you buy it?
- Cake?

453
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,459
Yes. People will think I'm crazy.

454
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:26,370
When a family gathers together, you call that a party.

455
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,470
It's way better than spending the day all depressed.

456
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,070
There's someone missing though. Sun Kyung is in Jeju Island.

457
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,470
What a weirdo.

458
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,939
Why did he go there all by himself when neither of us are there?

459
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:38,010
I guess he doesn't need us.

460
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,979
Aunt, don't give him money, okay?

461
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,780
Why? Did he get himself in trouble again?

462
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,220
Gosh, I should teach that punk a lesson.

463
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,890
How are you going to do that when you're in Canada?

464
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:53,660
Gosh, it's freezing here in Canada.

465
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,629
I can't believe I moved here at this age for love.

466
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,970
I guess you're doing well...

467
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,530
seeing that you're still talking about love.

468
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,769
How's work?

469
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,669

470
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:10,379

That's good to hear.

474
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,050
I just wish life would continue to be like this.

475
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,419
Really?

476
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,390
You, Sun Kyung, and I have been through enough.

477
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,090
I guess your parents are finally starting to help us from the skies.

478
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,160
Now we just need Sun Kyung to get a decent job.

481

482
00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:45,079
Okay. Don't worry.

00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,930
I want to be happy with my family.

500
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,769
I want everything destroyed!

501
00:38:28,669 --> 00:38:31,039
Just bring doom to this world!

502
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:42,149
I smell alcohol in this wish.

503
00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:52,620
(Small Village Makgeolli)

504
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,979
Gosh, who's here at this hour?

505
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:18,249
(3:33am, November 24, Tuesday)

506
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,530
My gosh.

507
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,070
Gosh, how annoying.

508
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:38,140
Seriously.

509
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:19,879
Hello.

510
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,820
I pranked you so you'd quickly open the door.

511
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,649
- What?
- I'm talking about how you saw...

512
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:30,220
Switzerland and Italy through the peephole.

513
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,370
Why is he...

514
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:44,039
Yes, I know I'm handsome.

515
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:48,169
My gosh. What are you doing here?

516
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:49,570
You called me here.

517
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,640
What?

518
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,709
I did?

519
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,749
Yes, you called me.

520
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,519
Who are you?

521
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,620
Myul Mang.

522
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:09,390
You took ages to come to the door, so I thought your house was big.

523
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,399
But it's tiny.

524
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:12,629
Hey! What...

525
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,499
Don't just stand there. Sit down.

526
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:21,070
This is my house.

527
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,970
I know. Don't worry about it.

528
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,209
The anniversary of someone's death?

529
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,680
Today's my birthday.

530
00:41:35,649 --> 00:41:37,689
Oh, really? I see.

531
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:40,430
Happy birthday.

532
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:43,959
No one's congratulated me on my birthday before.

533
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,640
Don't bother wasting your energy. It won't take long.

534
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,370
You just need to tell me your wish out loud.

535
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,439
What?

536
00:41:57,939 --> 00:42:00,510
- What wish?
- You wanted this world to end.

537
00:42:03,149 --> 00:42:05,550
Just bring doom to this world!

538
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,289
You were listening to me?

539
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:10,289
You knew where I lived? Were you roaming around my house?

540
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,090
No, I didn't. I'm busy.

541
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,640
Who are you?

542
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,780
What do you want?

543
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,320
Is it cake?

544
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,590
We don't have time. You're going to die soon.

545
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,269
Exactly 100 days later.

546
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:12,249
What... By any chance,

547
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:15,149
are you from the hospital?

548
00:43:16,419 --> 00:43:17,820
Do you think a doctor can do that?

549
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,629
No, I'm sure they can't.

550
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,160
My birthday doesn't come easily.

551
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:26,530
It travels worldwide and through the fates of many people.

552
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,099
So hurry up and make a wish before it's too late.

553
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,809
I didn't know glioblastoma would bring this kind of symptom.

554
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:40,879
- What?
- I'm hallucinating.

555
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:42,479
This is so cool.

556
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,320
I guess you need more time.

557
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:50,890
This situation is very unrealistic, so I understand.

558
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:51,959
What?

559
00:43:53,629 --> 00:43:56,360
It's okay. My birthday isn't over yet.

560
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,470
See you later.

561
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,890
Is this a dream?

562
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,530
Of course not.

563
00:44:52,379 --> 00:44:55,689
No, wait. My gosh.

564
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,490
I don't get it. I really don't.

565
00:45:25,419 --> 00:45:26,649
It's taking longer than expected.

566
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:44,439
What's going on? Where am I?

567
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,979
My house.

568
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:54,709
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

569
00:45:54,979 --> 00:45:56,079
It's his house?

570
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,579
Did I get kidnapped?

571
00:45:58,579 --> 00:46:01,450
I guess you could say that. But to be more exact,

572
00:46:01,649 --> 00:46:03,990
I came into your dream without permission.

573
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,390
My dream?

574
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,039
So you're saying this is a dream?

575
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:27,579
Seriously?

576
00:46:31,649 --> 00:46:33,519
- Is this real?
- I know you're dreaming,

577
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:35,649
but have some manners. This is my house.

578
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:37,820
Look who's talking. You also...

579
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,090
By the way, why do you keep talking to me without honorifics?

580
00:46:42,629 --> 00:46:44,099
You talked to me like that first.

581
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:47,200
- I did?
- "Just bring doom to this world."

582
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,800
You said it without honorifics, so I thought that's what you wanted.

583
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,499
I wasn't talking to you when I said that.

584
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:55,039
Then whom were you talking to?

585
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,439
I'm doom itself.

586
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,450
So you're telling me this is a dream?

587
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:15,930
What?

588
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:19,829
Where's the front door?

589
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,399
I'm going to go home.

590
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:36,079
I guess you don't like the location.

591
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:48,689
It's where you wanted to go.

592
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,800
It's for the cake.

593
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,599
So are you saying...

594
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,370
you're doom?

595
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,640
I'm responsible for everything that dies or gets destroyed.

596
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:08,410
Then why not end the world yourself? Why do you keep asking me for help?

597
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:09,749
Do you think I haven't tried?

598
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,079
It didn't work.

599
00:48:12,379 --> 00:48:14,189
It's probably because I'm just a small part of a system.

600
00:48:14,189 --> 00:48:15,749
What? I don't get what you mean.

601
00:48:15,749 --> 00:48:19,019
In other words, you guys have more authority than I do.

602
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,959
It's how mother nature works.

603
00:48:22,459 --> 00:48:24,860
But this time, I'm hoping it might be different...

604
00:48:25,459 --> 00:48:26,829
because it's what a human being wants.

605
00:48:27,669 --> 00:48:29,970
But why does that have to be me?

606
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:32,039
No one's ever looked up to a shooting star...

607
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:33,300
and made a wish like you.

608
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:40,550
Then do you disappear if you don't grant a wish?

609
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,410
That's what happens in fantasy novels.

610
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,220
Of course not.

611
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:47,849
It's just a small event.

612
00:48:48,019 --> 00:48:51,959
I was told to become someone's wish on the day I was born.

613
00:48:57,129 --> 00:48:59,329
Is this a nightmare?

614
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,129
Your life is a nightmare.

615
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,039
What?

616
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,539
Unfortunately, it's time for you to wake up.

617
00:49:13,809 --> 00:49:14,879
What?

618
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,700
It was a dream.

619
00:49:35,729 --> 00:49:36,899
It was a dream.

620
00:49:55,689 --> 00:49:58,419
It was a dream. I swear it was.

621
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:06,030
Look at all this dirt.

622
00:50:06,729 --> 00:50:09,499
My gosh, that crazy punk!

623
00:50:09,499 --> 00:50:12,169
Is he American or what?

624
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,539
My gosh.

625
00:50:39,729 --> 00:50:40,999
I'll help you feel no pain.

626
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,510
You won't feel any kind of pain as you die.

627
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,570
What do you say?

628
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,919
I'd like a roll of gimbap.

629
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,320
Fine.

630
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,399
I'll grant you another wish.

631
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,629
Not something you wished for when you were drunk...

632
00:51:14,629 --> 00:51:16,470
but something you truly want.

633
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,039
But this is as far as I can go.

634
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:27,379
(Original Gimbap)

635
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,289
Let's not listen to the lunatic.

636
00:51:35,149 --> 00:51:36,519
Don't listen to him.

637
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,030
My gosh, does everyone in the city go to work using the subway?

638
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,899
Why can't they all just disappear?

639
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,030
See? You also want it.

640
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:24,640
You...

641
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,059
I'm sick. I'm definitely sick.

642
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:54,729
Ms. Tak.

643
00:52:58,999 --> 00:53:01,070
Thanks to the cafe owner downstairs,

644
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,579
I postponed my resignation to tomorrow again.

645
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,479
Ms. Jo, about yesterday...

646
00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:09,280
Mr. Park isn't coming to work today.

647
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:11,749
He probably went to kneel before his girlfriend again.

648
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:14,249
- What?
- He was too hysterical yesterday.

649
00:53:14,249 --> 00:53:16,450
So we assumed he fought with his girlfriend again.

650
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,519
Da In heard them fight on the rooftop.

651
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,860
Apparently, it was a huge mess.

652
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,800
He really needs to stop bringing in his private life to work.

653
00:53:26,129 --> 00:53:27,370
Thank you for this.

654
00:53:29,229 --> 00:53:31,700
Sure. Enjoy your coffee.

655
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,070
Just don't get furious and end up quitting your job.

656
00:53:35,439 --> 00:53:38,039
If you quit, we'll have to suffer. You know that, right?

657
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,849
Why aren't you answering me?

658
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:42,910
Hey.

659
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:46,519
Ms. Tak.

660
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,450
The writer for "Siberia" is in the meeting room.

661
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:50,620
Already?

662
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:54,559
It's not time for the meeting yet.

663
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,800
Writers can be really self-centered.

664
00:54:08,939 --> 00:54:10,840
Where's the writer?

665
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:12,640
He's inside.

666
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:17,979
There he is.

667
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,360
Are you a stalker or an American? Just choose one already.

668
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:30,930
I also sold gimbap and was also a doctor.

669
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:33,769
What did you do to them? It's like they're bewitched.

670
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:36,200
I really did bewitch them.

671
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,269
This is driving me crazy. Have I really lost it?

672
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,410
No, you haven't lost it.

673
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:51,849
The writer is wandering around somewhere. I needed time with you.

674
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:53,579
How do you know?

675
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:54,820
I know because I sent him somewhere.

676
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:57,059
No, not that. How can you read my mind?

677
00:54:58,919 --> 00:55:00,689
I guess you're a little dull.

678
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,430
By any chance, are you...

679
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,399
I have a question for you.

680
00:55:05,399 --> 00:55:08,200
Why do you work here if you hate the CEO and the firm?

681
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,269
Should I get rid of your CEO for you?

682
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,010
I can make it happen if that's your wish.

683
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:16,870
Stop reading my mind.

684
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:19,709
To be more exact, I hear things. I don't read them.

685
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:20,979
Stop listening.

686
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,720
Then accept my offer.

687
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,050
I'm unable to read or hear the minds of those who make a promise with me.

688
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:30,890
Get out.

689
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,200
I'll just leave instead.

690
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:45,240
I'm going to go and meet Ms. Lee Hyun.

691
00:55:48,439 --> 00:55:50,039
Thank you for the coffee.

692
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,979
Ji Na.

693
00:55:58,979 --> 00:56:01,220
Hey, I just woke up.

694
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,720
Why are you calling? Aren't you going to come anyway?

695
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,019
Something's driving me nuts.

696
00:56:05,419 --> 00:56:07,689
What happened? Did your CEO bother you again?

697
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,999
A doctor... No, this American...

698
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:13,700
No, this crazy guy... I mean, this guy who sells gimbap...

699
00:56:15,669 --> 00:56:18,599
- Gosh, where do I begin?
- What?

700
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,079
("Welcoming the Destruction of Lowell")

701
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,939
Never mind. I'll tell you when we meet.

702
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:10,689
Nothing changed even after I was told that I'll be dying.

703
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:15,959
You're not scared of things you can't see...

704
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,660
such as death or destruction.

705
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:22,200
But once they become visible,

706
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:26,200
your fear suddenly becomes real.

707
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:47,530
Pain...

708
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:49,689
is real.

709
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,769
Oh, dear.

710
00:58:11,149 --> 00:58:14,890
Tell me. Who's having fun playing around with my life?

711
00:58:15,789 --> 00:58:16,849
Hey!

712
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,860
The deity is on my side.

713
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,669
Choose. Will you die here and now?

714
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,240
Or will you take my hand?

715
01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:25,019
And the answer is...

716
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,490
Me.

717
01:01:00,149 --> 01:01:04,919
And just like that, I held Myul Mang's hand.

718
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:46,030
(Doom at Your Service)

719
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,430
You said to become a human's wish.

720
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:52,070
But that human's wish happens to be doom.

721
01:01:52,999 --> 01:01:57,209
Why me? Why? Why must it be me?

722
01:01:57,479 --> 01:01:58,579
Fate.

723
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,180
Smile.

724
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,379
Why are you so nice to me all of a sudden?

725
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,780
Get off me!

726
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,120
I'll take care of it. You should go inside and eat.

727
01:02:06,149 --> 01:02:08,320
Shall we meet again tomorrow? Should I go pick you up?

728
01:02:08,419 --> 01:02:09,419
What's with you?

729
01:02:09,419 --> 01:02:11,360
You should be a bit more clingy.

730
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:12,860
What? To you?

731
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:15,030
No, to your fate that came to you.

732
01:02:19,023 --> 01:02:21,123
