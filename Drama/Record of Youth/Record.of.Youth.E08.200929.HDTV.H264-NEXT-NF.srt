RECORD OF YOUTH

2
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,358
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS AN
"EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT" AND IS SUPPORTED

3
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:09,045
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, TOURISM
AND THE KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,674
How about some music?

5
00:00:18,216 --> 00:00:19,217
Sure.

6
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:45,660
Hae-hyo.

7
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:48,288
Do you know Jung Ji-a?

8
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:49,706
Did you date her?

9
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,416
No, Hye-jun did.

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,127
Oh, right. Jin-u talked about her too.

11
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:56,922
My gosh, Hye-jun has high standards.

12
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:59,466
It's Ji-a that has high standards.

13
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,010
He and the girl he's seeing now
are a perfect match.

14
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:03,386
Who's a perfect match?

15
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,388
Hye-jun and his girlfriend.

16
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:08,058
Hye-jun has a girlfriend? Who is it?

17
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:10,060
It's none of your business, Mother.

18
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:13,688
His career still hasn't taken off.
I can't believe he has a girlfriend.

19
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,607
He got a role in <i>Gateway</i>.

20
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:18,985
My gosh, it sounds like
things are going well for Hye-jun.

21
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:20,445
Poor you.

22
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:23,657
You're single, and you don't even
have any dramas lined up.

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,908
You little…

24
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:27,869
I'm coming up with a plan
for your brother.

25
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,623
You've already read this,
so read the other ones.

26
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:33,291
There are so many.

27
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,210
You thought he wasn't getting any work?

28
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:37,754
He was in a movie and played the lead
in a web drama.

29
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:41,216
It's just none of them was a big hit
even though he's been working nonstop.

30
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:43,885
We need to find that big hit.

31
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:47,264
I've been too easy on you.
Look at you saying this to my face.

32
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:48,807
I said I'll figure it out.

33
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,227
Let's not fight. I'm on your side.

34
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,647
Put me to good use
instead of trying to push me away.

35
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,316
I won't go anywhere
even if you push me away.

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,818
So just give up.

37
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:03,155
What happens if I get angry?

38
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:04,364
A war will break out.

39
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:08,743
Will you give up?

40
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:11,079
No.

41
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:51,661
Let's listen to something else.

42
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:02,589
I'm hungry.

43
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:05,425
Me too. Do you want to go eat something?

44
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:08,803
No. I'll gain weight if I eat now.

45
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:11,473
You shouldn't either.
You need to stay fit for the shoot.

46
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:13,391
I always stay fit.

47
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:15,644
-I can eat now.
-No, you can't.

48
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:18,605
I'm saying it's fine.
Why are you saying I can't?

49
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:21,066
You're being overbearing.

50
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:23,193
So? You don't like me?

51
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:25,612
I like you.

52
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:27,739
Let's go.

53
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:30,242
What would you like to order?

54
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,369
Just a moment, please.

55
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:35,997
Hae-hyo's the model,
so we should buy some.

56
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:38,541
Doughnuts are the best
when your blood sugar falls low.

57
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,293
I thought you weren't eating.

58
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:42,420
Don't attack me using
what I said in the past.

59
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:44,339
Point taken. What do you want to drink?

60
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,801
Coffee.

61
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:50,679
It'll make me stay up all night,
but I still want coffee.

62
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:51,805
No.

63
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,182
I want coffee.

64
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:02,065
This isn't fair. Why order me milk
when you're having what you wanted?

65
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:04,067
You're being overbearing.

66
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:05,777
So? You don't like me?

67
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:07,779
I like you.

68
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,616
Smoothies and doughnuts are both sweet.

69
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,243
It goes better with coffee.

70
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:15,787
I don't know why people drink coffee.
It's too bitter.

71
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,916
You're like a kid.

72
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,631
On your lips.

73
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:29,634
Here.

74
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:35,181
By the way, you have such big hands.

75
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:36,725
It'll cover half of your face.

76
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:38,727
Is it big?

77
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:43,815
-I guess it is.
-I can't see a thing.

78
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,485
Did you want to see me that much?

79
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:53,950
That was too cheesy.

80
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:55,744
I like it.

81
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,038
You do?

82
00:04:58,121 --> 00:04:59,539
-Yes.
-Wasn't it too childish?

83
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:03,835
That's why I like it.
I want to feel like a kid when I date.

84
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,547
When it comes to dating,
I don't want to be too realistic.

85
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:10,717
Reality has been hitting me hard
since I was little.

86
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:14,012
Let's do that if that's what you want.

87
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:17,640
-But you don't want to?
-I probably can't be like that.

88
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:21,061
The more you love someone,
the more responsible you become.

89
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:23,396
I'm happy I'm dating such a good guy.

90
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:26,900
This is how you're training me
to do better.

91
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:27,817
You could tell?

92
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:35,533
I'm going to dye my hair black.

93
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:38,161
-Why?
-Because I'm playing a doctor.

94
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:42,040
-But you don't have the script yet.
-They told me about the character.

95
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:43,792
I'll dye your hair.

96
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,544
Isn't it a nuisance?
Work's keeping you busy enough.

97
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:51,549
Your girlfriend's a makeup artist.
I can certainly do that much for you.

98
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,968
And I've been promoted to designer.

99
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,221
I heard I got promoted very fast.

100
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:58,181
I'm so relaxed when I'm with you.

101
00:05:58,723 --> 00:05:59,933
I feel secure.

102
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:03,061
Like how my name sounds in Korean.

103
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:05,480
An Jeong-ha makes you feel secure.

104
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:09,067
My name, Sa Hye-jun,
can mean "forgiveness."

105
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:12,445
Does that mean
I have to forgive everything?

106
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:14,906
This is amazing.

107
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:19,077
Don't forget. You have to forgive me
no matter what I do.

108
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,663
Deal.

109
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:29,003
Eat.

110
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:32,966
-Seeing you eat fills me up.
-Gosh, cut it out.

111
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:40,767
RECORD OF YOUTH

112
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,105
EPISODE 8

113
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:57,157
I'm sorry, but can you bring me
my tablet PC?

114
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,575
Sure, no problem.

115
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,919
I heard Hye-jun got a role in <i>Gateway</i>.

116
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:10,962
What kind of role?

117
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:12,172
Pardon me?

118
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:16,259
You didn't know? The drama will air soon.

119
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:20,472
Oh, he hasn't told you,
so it's probably a minor role

120
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:21,973
with only a few lines.

121
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:24,934
-I see.
-I heard he's got a girlfriend.

122
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:26,394
You didn't know?

123
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:32,108
Good for you.

124
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:35,320
Your kids just figure stuff out
on their own. How convenient is that?

125
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:37,614
My gosh, I have so much to do.

126
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:40,492
Hae-hyo's acting career,
military service, marriage, and kids.

127
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:43,536
Hae-na's law school, law firm,
marriage, and kids.

128
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,996
Will it ever end?

129
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:48,166
I'll probably have to look after them
until I turn 70.

130
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:56,925
Why are you all quiet? You always have
something to say about the kids.

131
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:58,468
Today, I have nothing to say.

132
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:02,138
The look on your face tells me
that isn't the case.

133
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:04,182
You seem upset.

134
00:08:04,974 --> 00:08:06,559
-Do I look upset?
-Yes.

135
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:11,105
I see. I guess I can't hide my feelings.

136
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:13,316
Wait.

137
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:18,613
Gosh, what's with her?
What does that make me?

138
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:28,748
I didn't know I let my feelings show
even in front of Hae-hyo's mother.

139
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,300
But Hye-jun really is
taking care of everything on his own.

140
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:56,109
Is everything okay with your family?

141
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:58,278
Hey, don't scare me.

142
00:08:58,361 --> 00:08:59,487
Goodness.

143
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:05,868
<i>Hye-jun, congratulations.
I heard you got a role in a drama.</i>

144
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:06,995
<i>Seriously?</i>

145
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:09,205
I doubt it.

146
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:11,833
-What's going on?
-Hye-jun got a role in a drama.

147
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,126
That's amazing.

148
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:15,128
<i>Is he sure this time?</i>

149
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:18,548
<i>We'll find out once the drama airs.
Why bother asking?</i>

150
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:20,425
<i>It's great news. Can't you be positive?</i>

151
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:23,761
Even last time, it fell through.
We won't know until it happens.

152
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:28,683
I actually hope it falls through
so that he can learn his lesson.

153
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:31,811
<i>Don't forget to meet me later.</i>

154
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:33,896
He's finally back to himself.

155
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,733
<i>Gyeong-jun, what a great brother you are.</i>

156
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:39,319
<i>How come Hye-jun isn't saying anything?</i>

157
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:44,782
Come on in. I made sure to get ready
just before you arrived.

158
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:46,534
-Aren't I so good?
-Be good at other things.

159
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:49,037
-You'll bring me down?
-As if that's possible.

160
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,121
It is.

161
00:09:50,204 --> 00:09:52,540
Keep your spirits up.
You're doing a great job.

162
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,253
My gosh, that line…

163
00:09:57,337 --> 00:09:59,631
Hey, you just made my heart skip a beat.

164
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:03,343
Goodness, people need to see this.
This needs to be seen.

165
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:16,064
HYE-JUN
…

166
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:19,400
I asked him why he's not saying anything,
and he sent three dots.

167
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:28,618
Hae-hyo is handsome.

168
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:31,788
Although Hye-jun is more handsome.

169
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:38,836
Have you found anyone who's a good cook?

170
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,756
-Yes, she can take the job.
-It's someone you trust, right?

171
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,051
You know Jin-u, right?
She's Jin-u's mother.

172
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:46,511
I see.

173
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:50,223
<i>Is this a school parent meeting or what?</i>

174
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:51,391
When can she start?

175
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:53,601
I'll give you her number.
You can contact her.

176
00:10:53,684 --> 00:10:55,019
-Okay.
-By the way,

177
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:58,940
Hae-hyo was the one who told you
that Hye-jun is seeing someone, right?

178
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,192
How long has he been seeing her?

179
00:11:01,818 --> 00:11:03,736
I didn't think he'd date anyone

180
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,363
after breaking up with his ex.

181
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:08,825
But you know, Hye-jun can't really afford
to be dating now.

182
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:12,286
<i>Look at her throwing a hook just because
I've let my guard down a little.</i>

183
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,915
These days, people say
that you should be grateful

184
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:18,042
if your kids can date without your help.

185
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:20,753
<i>What's with her these days?
She always talks back to me.</i>

186
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:23,923
You know a lot of things.

187
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:25,007
Thank you.

188
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,552
<i>That was not a compliment.</i>

189
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:33,891
Are you going to stand there?
Don't you find this noisy?

190
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:39,981
DAD

191
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,403
Hi, Dad.

192
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:46,487
<i>Where are you?</i>

193
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,406
On the bus. I'm headed to the salon.

194
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:50,241
You're headed there early today.

195
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:53,286
I'm going to the hospital.
Don't be surprised.

196
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:55,580
You got me worried.
Is everything okay with her?

197
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:57,915
She got a facelift yesterday.

198
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:01,752
<i>She's pretty, but she keeps on
comparing herself to when she was young.</i>

199
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:03,254
<i>I'm on my way to pick her up.</i>

200
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:06,424
Good for her that she's married
to a man like you.

201
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:09,343
And good for you
that you have a dad like me.

202
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:13,055
<i>Will you ever call me first?</i>

203
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:15,600
I miss you, Jeong-ha.

204
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,435
I miss you too.

205
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:21,063
But I'm on the bus now,
so I can't talk long.

206
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:23,774
<i>Oh, okay. I'll visit you soon.</i>

207
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:31,866
Good morning.

208
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:45,838
I'll do your makeup for your blind date
tomorrow. I'll make you look lovely.

209
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:48,508
My gosh, I'd love that.

210
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:52,970
How about salad for lunch? There is
new salad place across the street.

211
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:56,682
If anyone wants salad, let me know.
I'll put in the order for everyone.

212
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,644
Can you ask Su-bin too?

213
00:13:01,354 --> 00:13:03,314
She has such a thick skin.

214
00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:06,192
I know. I can't beat her.

215
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:10,988
APPOINTMENT LIST
DESIGNER: AN JEONG-HA

216
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:18,496
Those who bring you down

217
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:22,166
and want to destroy you.

218
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:30,550
You're fully booked today.

219
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,677
You seem immensely interested in me.

220
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,429
When are you going to quit?

221
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:44,188
I'm well aware of the fact that
I can't change things no matter what I do.

222
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:47,900
You're smart. I see that
you're always quick to gauge situations.

223
00:13:54,115 --> 00:13:56,117
Why are you doing all this?

224
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,911
Do you know why someone
would come to hate you the most?

225
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:01,539
They just hate you.

226
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:04,125
But one good thing about it is that

227
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,585
it's giving me so much energy.

228
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:09,171
The wheels are turning in my head
to come up with a way to kick you out.

229
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,425
I'm realizing that I should just pity you.

230
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:13,885
How dare you!

231
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:18,890
Now that I know
what kind of person you are,

232
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:21,976
I'll not let you have it your way.

233
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,196
Hot off the press.

234
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:40,119
You won't read it?

235
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:42,455
I'm going to the library
to do some research.

236
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:43,748
Which department?

237
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:45,708
Emergency Medicine.

238
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,002
-What can I refer to?
-Remember <i>ER</i>?

239
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:49,795
Although it's an old drama.

240
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:53,215
But that's not important.
Your romantic eyes--

241
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:56,135
You're at it again? Don't be so shallow.

242
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:59,555
Being shallow isn't bad.
It's about your preference.

243
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,767
Okay, I'll respect your preferences.

244
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:06,812
Let's have lunch and head out together.

245
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:09,815
No, I want to go study.
I'm seeing Gyeong-jun in the evening.

246
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:11,442
Where are you going?

247
00:15:12,276 --> 00:15:14,153
You're starting a new drama.

248
00:15:14,236 --> 00:15:15,571
I'm seeing the reporters

249
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:18,282
to say hello and stay on their good side.

250
00:15:23,704 --> 00:15:25,331
Hello.

251
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:30,086
I should have visited you sooner.
I'm sorry it took me some time.

252
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:35,174
I know the other director at A June
very well.

253
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:38,177
-Nice to meet you. She's my junior.
-Hello.

254
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,513
I enjoyed your article. Let's sit down.

255
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:43,349
You were stressed out because of Do-ha.

256
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:45,851
There were many mean comments
about that article.

257
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:47,937
We were also criticized
for poor management.

258
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,899
Will Do-ha and Jessica
both be in the mini-series, <i>Catch</i>?

259
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:54,944
As for Jessica, it's been finalized.
And Do-ha…

260
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:59,949
It hasn't been confirmed yet,
but you'll be the first to know.

261
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:03,077
Nice. You can publish an exclusive.

262
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,037
JJAMPPONG LEE MIN-JAE

263
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:06,664
Oh, sorry.

264
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:07,790
No problem.

265
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,085
Hello, Ms. Lee. Yes.

266
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:14,630
One of the top writers is working on it.

267
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:16,257
I'll tell you all about that too.

268
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:19,051
Thank you.

269
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:21,679
I'm in a meeting now.
I'll call you back in a bit.

270
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:24,473
Okay. All right.

271
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:30,896
Do you know about JJamppong Entertainment?

272
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,356
<i>JJamppong, again?</i>

273
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,442
There's such an entertainment agency?

274
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:36,360
JJamppong? What kind of name is that?

275
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:38,696
Is it a joke or what?

276
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,240
But she's very nice.

277
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:46,037
I was going to just introduce myself
and have a cup of tea with you.

278
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,290
But I have to say, I really like you.

279
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:50,875
Do you like to drink?

280
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:55,171
I know it's still early, but we can drink
until we drop if you're free.

281
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,858
DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE

282
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:46,055
So who's that bastard?

283
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:48,265
The bastard who wants me dead.

284
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:50,518
It's actually a woman.
She's an office worker.

285
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:54,647
She begged for mercy,
but I said flat out, "No way."

286
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,856
Good.

287
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,652
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

288
00:17:59,735 --> 00:18:02,029
I can't say no after meeting
the director and writer.

289
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:05,783
I'll take care of all the difficult stuff.
Just do what you want to do.

290
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,416
Do-ha, you're very quiet.

291
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:17,545
I'm shy.

292
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:19,088
I see.

293
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:20,881
I'm a fan of your dramas.

294
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:21,966
Thank you.

295
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:24,218
His work is delicate but powerful.

296
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:25,386
Gosh.

297
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:28,430
Let's get down to the point.
You'll join us on the drama, right?

298
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:31,475
I should, since the two of you
are working on it.

299
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,727
Thank you. Let's do a great job.

300
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:36,272
Oh, have you finished casting
for the other roles?

301
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:39,441
Who's playing Yeong-min? I interact
with him the most, after Jessica.

302
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:41,652
We have two candidates.

303
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:43,571
Lee Yong-ju and Tae Yeong-jin.

304
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:45,906
-I see.
-I see.

305
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,827
And for another role,
we're thinking Won Hae-hyo or Lee Ji-seop.

306
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,662
Hae-hyo? I like Hae-hyo.

307
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:54,123
Won Hae-hyo? Are you close?

308
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:56,208
We shot a movie together. He's easygoing.

309
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:57,626
I see. I've never met him.

310
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,836
I should meet him soon.

311
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,171
Yes, you should.

312
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:05,301
I'll need your ID
if you'd like a new debit card.

313
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:08,345
Where did it go? I'm in a huge rush.

314
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:09,889
-Please hurry.
-Okay.

315
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:15,394
Where is the option
for reissuing a debit card?

316
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:18,314
You don't know how to do it?

317
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:20,065
No, because it's not my duty.

318
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:22,109
You know I jumped in to help out.

319
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:24,361
So it's not something you normally do?

320
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:25,863
Anyway, please hurry.

321
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:29,116
It's on the far left of the main menu bar.

322
00:19:31,827 --> 00:19:32,995
Oh, there it is.

323
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:36,957
Ms. Kim Ju-yun.

324
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:42,796
Please fill this out--

325
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,506
Gosh, what the hell.

326
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,133
What an incompetent clerk.

327
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:50,095
I'm not incompetent. This isn't my duty,
but I'm helping out my colleague.

328
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:51,680
Please understand.

329
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:55,434
Do you know what Mr. Sa said
in front of a customer earlier?

330
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:58,354
-What did he say?
-Is he a fact-checker or what?

331
00:19:58,437 --> 00:20:01,106
He wants to show off
that he's an SNU graduate.

332
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,276
What's the use though?
He's so incompetent.

333
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,904
He even fell victim to a rental scam.

334
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:10,866
Gosh, that is ridiculous.
And he acts all smart?

335
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:14,536
-Goodness.
-I heard he lost all his money.

336
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:17,164
Anyhow…

337
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:26,382
I wonder why people always
bad-mouth others in the restroom.

338
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:29,927
And the person being bad-mouthed
always happens to hear it.

339
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,807
Sorry about that.
Why don't we go grab a drink later?

340
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,101
I can't. I have plans.

341
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:40,271
Okay. Another time, then.

342
00:20:41,897 --> 00:20:43,023
Let's go.

343
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:44,692
We're sorry.

344
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:50,614
It's so easy for them to say sorry.

345
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:54,451
I want to punch them, but I can't.

346
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:55,995
I need this job.

347
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,502
The bastard who conned me…

348
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:07,339
I hope his family suffers
for three generations.

349
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:27,234
Yes, ma'am.

350
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,069
-Mr. Sa.
-Yes.

351
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:32,865
It is your duty to help out the customers
when others are busy.

352
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:34,992
Why must you always draw the line?

353
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:38,620
If there isn't a clear line,
you don't know who's responsible for what.

354
00:21:38,704 --> 00:21:42,708
Then someone could be
wrongly accused of a mistake.

355
00:21:44,126 --> 00:21:46,170
I heard you were born in 1992.

356
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,213
-Yes.
-I was so surprised.

357
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:49,631
You look older than your age.

358
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:52,843
I looked like this in middle school.

359
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:54,803
Because of you, I even read a book called

360
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:57,097
<i>90's Kids Are Coming.</i>

361
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,933
I'm trying to understand you better.

362
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:05,022
Can you please listen to your superiors
and do as you're told?

363
00:22:05,105 --> 00:22:06,356
Yes, ma'am. I'll try.

364
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,900
You must try your best.

365
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:11,361
You must try a hundred times harder
than others.

366
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:12,780
"Others"? What do you mean--

367
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,573
Forget it, Trooper.

368
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:15,949
Go back to your desk.

369
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,535
That's it for today.

370
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:20,329
Yes, ma'am.

371
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,110
-What do you want to eat?
-What's good around here?

372
00:22:51,193 --> 00:22:54,905
Around here? There's a <i>galbi</i> restaurant
and grilled clams…

373
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:56,615
-Mr. Sa?
-Yes?

374
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,158
Who is he?

375
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:00,410
Oh, say hello. This is my manager.

376
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,705
Hello, I'm Sa Hye-jun.

377
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,040
He's my little brother.

378
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:07,126
Seriously?

379
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:09,461
<i>I hate this world.</i>

380
00:23:09,545 --> 00:23:12,673
<i>People judge others
based on money and looks.</i>

381
00:23:12,756 --> 00:23:15,342
By any chance, aren't you a model?

382
00:23:15,425 --> 00:23:16,677
You look familiar.

383
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,680
I used to model
but have switched to acting.

384
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:21,014
I knew it.

385
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:22,391
I could tell.

386
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,144
You're so handsome.

387
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:28,355
What brings you here?

388
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:30,524
We're having dinner together.

389
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:33,986
My gosh, I haven't had dinner yet either.

390
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:38,407
Go have dinner. I'll be off, then.

391
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,491
Let's go.

392
00:23:40,117 --> 00:23:41,076
-Take care.
-Bye.

393
00:23:43,412 --> 00:23:44,830
That heartless jerk.

394
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,085
You should drink too.

395
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:52,504
I said I won't drink in the evening
for a while.

396
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,674
Gosh, you're so strict.

397
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,677
You said the shoot will begin next week.

398
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,429
It's only a week away.

399
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:04,016
Lucky you.

400
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:07,436
Everyone likes you
the moment they meet you.

401
00:24:08,812 --> 00:24:09,897
What's this nonsense?

402
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:13,233
Dad is so proud of you and calls you
the brain of the family.

403
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:17,613
Hey, it's not like I can walk around
with my report card or business card

404
00:24:18,197 --> 00:24:21,450
on my face so people know
I'm smart and have a good job.

405
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:23,785
Nothing can beat a handsome face.

406
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:25,204
Are you drunk?

407
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:27,539
Try to calculate the monetary value

408
00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:30,918
of the kindness you receive from others
thanks to your handsome face.

409
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:34,296
That's all you can do
when you were born with that face?

410
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:35,797
It's a serious problem.

411
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:37,633
You're drunk. Let's go home.

412
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:40,761
When I got conned,

413
00:24:41,762 --> 00:24:43,305
you didn't say anything

414
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:47,893
and just bought me dinner.
I was so grateful to you.

415
00:24:49,728 --> 00:24:53,273
I thought, "My little brother, Hye-jun,
is all grown up now.

416
00:24:53,815 --> 00:24:55,442
He's an adult now.

417
00:24:55,984 --> 00:24:58,278
He knows how to console others.

418
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:00,906
He's grown into such a cool guy."

419
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:01,990
Shut up.

420
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:05,327
I can't drink if I shut up.

421
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,121
Come on. Get up.

422
00:25:13,627 --> 00:25:16,129
Okay, I am getting up.

423
00:25:19,383 --> 00:25:21,885
Gosh, you're such a handful.

424
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:25,305
A handful? You use that word when
you're talking about things like food.

425
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:46,493
Don't eat it with your hand.

426
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:47,911
All right.

427
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:55,627
Gyeong-jun sure is the eldest child.

428
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:58,547
Look, he's taking Hye-jun out for dinner
despite his situation.

429
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,136
Go in.

430
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:05,887
Dad.

431
00:26:06,722 --> 00:26:08,140
Dad!

432
00:26:08,223 --> 00:26:09,224
Gosh, what happened?

433
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:10,726
Darn it.

434
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:13,770
-How come only he's drunk?
-Dad.

435
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:16,440
Why did you let him drink so much?

436
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,319
Do you only see how drunk he is and not
how I practically carried him home?

437
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:22,821
-Dad.
-Yes.

438
00:26:22,904 --> 00:26:24,114
Dad…

439
00:26:24,906 --> 00:26:27,743
My gosh, Gyeong-jun.
What's wrong? Who upset you?

440
00:26:30,912 --> 00:26:32,456
-I'm stressed out.
-Of course.

441
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,583
That son of a bitch.

442
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:39,379
I want the scammer's family
to suffer for three generations!

443
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:41,465
-Damn it.
-Yes, of course.

444
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:42,799
Stop, enough.

445
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:45,093
How can I stop?

446
00:26:45,177 --> 00:26:48,638
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that bastard's face.

447
00:26:48,722 --> 00:26:50,807
How can I stop thinking about it?

448
00:26:50,891 --> 00:26:52,351
Take him to his room.

449
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:54,186
-Mom.
-Shut it!

450
00:26:56,188 --> 00:26:57,397
It's okay.

451
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:04,279
Oh, here.

452
00:27:10,035 --> 00:27:11,370
I'll take that.

453
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:21,963
Thanks for carrying Gyeong-jun home.

454
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:26,551
Thanks for saying that.
I feel a bit better now.

455
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:32,224
But you hurt my feelings a little.

456
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,979
Why didn't you tell me
about getting the role in the drama?

457
00:27:38,897 --> 00:27:41,316
It fell through last time, you know.

458
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,193
I was going to tell you once it airs.

459
00:27:44,945 --> 00:27:47,948
But you'll be heartbroken
if it falls through.

460
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:50,325
You can turn to me at times like that.

461
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:58,500
I know that your dad
keeps hurting your feelings.

462
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:01,837
But it's not because he doesn't love you.

463
00:28:02,337 --> 00:28:05,799
He didn't receive affection
from his parents, so he doesn't know how.

464
00:28:07,175 --> 00:28:08,260
Try to understand him.

465
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:12,431
Don't just expect me to understand him.

466
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:16,476
Judging from the way he treats Gyeong-jun,
he obviously knows how to show affection.

467
00:28:19,563 --> 00:28:22,649
Right? It is your dad's fault.

468
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,693
Parents must give love first.

469
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:26,987
What the heck is he doing? How petty.

470
00:28:27,988 --> 00:28:29,698
If you take my side like that,

471
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:31,783
I can't stay mad.

472
00:28:32,576 --> 00:28:34,161
You're so clever, Mom.

473
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:39,082
Do you have anything else to tell me?

474
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,627
I'm pretty sure you do.

475
00:28:43,128 --> 00:28:46,006
I get really upset
when I hear about you from someone else.

476
00:28:49,718 --> 00:28:51,219
Your girlfriend.

477
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:54,389
Oh, Jeong-ha?

478
00:28:54,473 --> 00:28:56,141
Her name is Jeong-ha?

479
00:28:56,224 --> 00:28:58,977
Yes, Jeong-ha. An Jeong-ha.

480
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,479
-She's sweet.
-Is she?

481
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:01,772
Yes.

482
00:29:01,855 --> 00:29:03,315
That's good.

483
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:05,400
It's very important.

484
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:06,651
I'm sure I'll love her.

485
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:08,153
Do you want to meet her?

486
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:09,571
I'd love to.

487
00:29:10,864 --> 00:29:14,826
Since you brought that up first,
I can't stay mad at you either.

488
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:42,187
Welcome.

489
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:45,106
I thought we were doing it at the salon.

490
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:48,568
I can't use the salon for personal stuff.

491
00:29:49,611 --> 00:29:51,363
I don't like that either.

492
00:29:51,446 --> 00:29:53,240
We're similar in a lot of ways.

493
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:56,576
I have something for you.

494
00:30:01,957 --> 00:30:03,583
In return for your gift.

495
00:30:10,173 --> 00:30:11,591
What a beautiful illustration.

496
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:15,637
What did you write?

497
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:17,430
Read it later.

498
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:31,486
Applying some oil on your hair
before dyeing it

499
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:35,240
helps the dye job
and protects the hair from damage.

500
00:30:43,248 --> 00:30:44,249
That feels nice.

501
00:30:48,753 --> 00:30:52,007
All right, sir. We'll get started now.

502
00:31:05,312 --> 00:31:06,563
I'm coming in.

503
00:31:11,318 --> 00:31:12,485
How do I look?

504
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:17,741
The color turned out very nice.

505
00:31:21,494 --> 00:31:22,370
Don't do that.

506
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:25,457
Sorry.

507
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,501
All right, we should end this properly.

508
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:29,878
Here, some hand cream.

509
00:31:31,963 --> 00:31:34,257
Do you apply hand cream here first?

510
00:31:34,341 --> 00:31:36,384
Yes. What about you?

511
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,306
-How could you start there?
-Why start on the palm?

512
00:31:44,142 --> 00:31:45,393
You're set in your ways.

513
00:31:45,477 --> 00:31:47,437
Many people start on the back of the hand.

514
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,898
You're very opinionated.

515
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:51,650
Most people don't care.

516
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:54,945
Start on the back of the hand
and it'll feel less greasy on the palm.

517
00:31:57,072 --> 00:32:00,283
I've never pondered what's good
about putting it on the palm first.

518
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:02,202
I just applied it like how others did.

519
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:06,122
The fact that everyone does it
means it's the best way.

520
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:09,501
That's something only a stability-seeker
like you would say.

521
00:32:11,002 --> 00:32:14,172
The minority definitely looks classier
than the majority.

522
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:16,841
But I'd still like to be the majority.

523
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:18,468
Say that with a straight face on.

524
00:32:19,678 --> 00:32:22,138
-You win.
-It's not a battle.

525
00:32:22,222 --> 00:32:25,517
-I respect your preference.
-Hey. Stop that.

526
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,811
Hey.

527
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:41,199
<i>Dr. Park Jeong-geun,
please come to the ER.</i>

528
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,371
Hae-jin.

529
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:00,343
Did you finish tidying up?

530
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:07,684
What is it? You're scaring me.

531
00:33:09,185 --> 00:33:10,311
Can I ask you out?

532
00:33:17,235 --> 00:33:18,278
Can I hit you?

533
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:22,824
-Is that a no?
-Yes, it is.

534
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:26,786
Did you finish cleaning up?

535
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,247
That was way too fast.
I doubt that you're that good.

536
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,082
I'm good, too.

537
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:32,751
I may not be as good as you,

538
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,878
but I'll get there.

539
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:39,883
<i>Don't trip and fall.</i>

540
00:33:52,187 --> 00:33:53,229
Father.

541
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:55,190
He did it.

542
00:33:56,024 --> 00:33:57,692
He made it now.

543
00:33:57,776 --> 00:33:59,277
Father, why are you crying?

544
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,154
-I don't know.
-I'm home.

545
00:34:01,237 --> 00:34:03,031
I can't stop crying.

546
00:34:03,698 --> 00:34:05,700
Call him and find out
when he's coming home.

547
00:34:07,452 --> 00:34:08,495
What's wrong with him?

548
00:34:09,662 --> 00:34:10,955
Because I'm happy.

549
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:14,542
Honey, Hye-jun's drama
just finished airing.

550
00:34:14,626 --> 00:34:15,710
It's so weird!

551
00:34:15,794 --> 00:34:17,420
I bet it is.

552
00:34:17,504 --> 00:34:19,130
Why watch it? It's upsetting.

553
00:34:19,214 --> 00:34:21,216
It was weird because he was just amazing.

554
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:23,885
He didn't look like he's one of us.

555
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:25,261
Did you guys meet outside?

556
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:27,097
He and I had a drink.

557
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,767
Then, you should have come home early
and watched the drama with us.

558
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,228
I don't like dramas.
I'll only watch his clips.

559
00:34:37,232 --> 00:34:40,026
Father, get a grip.

560
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,655
Don't get too sentimental and think
that this actually means something.

561
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:49,994
He totally ruined the moment for me.

562
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:53,998
GYEONG-MI

563
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,461
Hey, Gyeong-mi.

564
00:34:58,545 --> 00:35:00,922
Ae-suk, this was amazing!

565
00:35:01,005 --> 00:35:03,299
I got butterflies.
Is that the same boy I know?

566
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:05,301
Hye-jun is going to hit it big!

567
00:35:09,013 --> 00:35:10,014
<i>Can I ask you out?</i>

568
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:12,559
<i>Can I hit you?</i>

569
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:16,771
<i>Is that a no?</i>

570
00:35:22,986 --> 00:35:25,572
Hae-hyo. Hae-hyo!

571
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:32,453
The episode was nice.

572
00:35:32,537 --> 00:35:34,664
You had great chemistry with Ms. Lee.

573
00:35:35,957 --> 00:35:37,709
MS. KIM I-YEONG

574
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:42,005
Hyeon-su is an incredible actress,
so I look pretty decent next to her.

575
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:45,049
Gosh. "Hyeon-su"?
When did you become such close friends?

576
00:35:47,427 --> 00:35:48,761
Are you still shooting?

577
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,514
Yes. But I only have one scene left.

578
00:35:52,265 --> 00:35:53,975
I couldn't even watch the episode.

579
00:35:54,058 --> 00:35:55,852
I watched it. You were great.

580
00:35:55,935 --> 00:35:57,020
We're rolling soon.

581
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,022
I have to go.

582
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:00,315
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

583
00:36:00,398 --> 00:36:01,441
Bye.

584
00:36:05,278 --> 00:36:06,321
Who was that?

585
00:36:06,404 --> 00:36:08,823
Hye-jun. I called him
after watching the episode.

586
00:36:08,907 --> 00:36:10,658
He was totally cute in the episode.

587
00:36:10,742 --> 00:36:12,076
Did you watch it?

588
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,620
I won't admit it even if I did.

589
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:17,707
Your drama will do better than his.
Don't worry.

590
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,625
I'm not worried.

591
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:21,377
Yes. You shouldn't worry.
I'll do all the worrying.

592
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:23,338
You'll be working with Park Do-ha.

593
00:36:23,421 --> 00:36:26,633
If his drama isn't a hit,
that itself is a problem.

594
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:45,985
-Here's water.
-Okay.

595
00:36:47,528 --> 00:36:50,031
Do-ha, when will your drama air?

596
00:36:50,114 --> 00:36:51,407
Early next month.

597
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:53,785
Which drama are you girls
watching these days?

598
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:55,328
<i>Gateway.</i>

599
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:57,622
Can I put this on now?

600
00:36:59,123 --> 00:37:01,334
-I heard that's popular nowadays.
-<i>Hae-jin.</i>

601
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:03,336
But the TV ratings aren't that high.

602
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:05,838
His name is Sa Hye-jun,
and he's in the limelight now.

603
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:08,174
<i>What is it? You're scaring me.</i>

604
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:12,971
<i>Can I ask you out?</i>

605
00:37:13,554 --> 00:37:14,931
He wants to ask her out!

606
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:16,933
I just became his fan.

607
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:18,101
<i>Can I hit you?</i>

608
00:37:21,187 --> 00:37:23,940
-Do-ha.
-Get out.

609
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:26,192
You have no sense of gratitude.

610
00:37:26,276 --> 00:37:27,694
I basically feed you girls.

611
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:30,154
Wait, is someone going to give us a meal?

612
00:37:30,238 --> 00:37:32,115
We can pay money for a meal ourselves.

613
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:34,158
I don't mooch off anyone.

614
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,662
-You're so dense.
-Girls, get out.

615
00:37:38,162 --> 00:37:39,247
We're leaving.

616
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:43,042
-Gosh.
-Just move aside.

617
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:52,051
Are you bothered?

618
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:53,344
This is ridiculous.

619
00:37:53,928 --> 00:37:55,972
How can they like someone else
when I'm here?

620
00:37:58,474 --> 00:37:59,475
You know what?

621
00:38:00,351 --> 00:38:01,686
You're a top star.

622
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:06,316
When your drama airs,
everyone's eyes will be on you.

623
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:13,072
<i>What is it? You're scaring me.</i>

624
00:38:14,657 --> 00:38:15,533
<i>Can I ask you out?</i>

625
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:22,623
"Can I ask you out?"

626
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:27,879
Was that supposed to make
my heart skip a beat? Seriously?

627
00:38:29,088 --> 00:38:32,675
That stupid writer. This doesn't work
anymore in this day and age. Gosh.

628
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:34,552
"Can I ask you out?"

629
00:38:36,054 --> 00:38:39,223
Sir, let's crank up the music.

630
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:40,350
Okay.

631
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:42,602
Gosh.

632
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:44,729
Goodness.

633
00:38:46,314 --> 00:38:48,107
<i>What is it? You're scaring me.</i>

634
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:51,736
-<i>Can I ask you out?</i>
-He's so handsome. What's his name?

635
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:53,905
Right. What is his name?

636
00:38:53,988 --> 00:38:56,407
-Hey, let's find out his name.
-Okay.

637
00:38:56,491 --> 00:38:58,117
-He's so handsome.
-It's Sa Hye-jun.

638
00:38:58,201 --> 00:39:00,119
<i>-Is that a no?
-Yes, it is.</i>

639
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,372
Do you know him?

640
00:39:02,455 --> 00:39:05,375
Well, I know him from my last job.

641
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:06,542
He was a model, then.

642
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:08,127
He used to be a model.

643
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:10,630
-That's why he's so tall.
-I knew it.

644
00:39:10,713 --> 00:39:14,008
Everyone liked him. He's nice and polite.

645
00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:15,593
I see.

646
00:39:15,676 --> 00:39:16,761
<i>Don't trip and fall.</i>

647
00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:23,851
Don't stare at me like that.
It's a bit uncomfortable.

648
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:25,770
-What?
-I'm leaving.

649
00:39:26,354 --> 00:39:27,814
-Gosh.
-Hey. Wait.

650
00:39:27,897 --> 00:39:30,358
If you have more information,
tell us before you go!

651
00:39:33,194 --> 00:39:35,321
<i>Cut</i>. Okay. Well done!

652
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:37,865
-Good work.
-Good job.

653
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:40,243
-Nice job.
-Thank you.

654
00:39:40,326 --> 00:39:42,829
-Great job.
-Good work.

655
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:45,206
Good work.

656
00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:47,500
-Good work. Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

657
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,793
-Well done.
-Good work.

658
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:50,795
-Good work.
-Good work.

659
00:39:50,878 --> 00:39:52,130
Hye-jun.

660
00:39:52,213 --> 00:39:54,465
-What is it?
-You didn't watch the episode, right?

661
00:39:55,341 --> 00:39:58,136
-My heart skipped a beat.
-Don't exaggerate it.

662
00:39:58,219 --> 00:39:59,846
My mom said you were handsome.

663
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:01,931
She's happy
that you're on TV more than I am.

664
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:03,391
Please thank her for me.

665
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:06,519
Your mother has great eyes.

666
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:09,439
-I'll be nice to you, Chi-yeong.
-Why would you be nice?

667
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:11,065
Do you not have your agent?

668
00:40:11,149 --> 00:40:12,692
Why are you always with Hye-jun?

669
00:40:12,775 --> 00:40:14,777
Because we have a lot of scenes together.

670
00:40:15,278 --> 00:40:16,487
Hye-jun.

671
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:18,614
Anyway, let's eat.

672
00:40:18,698 --> 00:40:21,409
Let's discuss what our next step is
during our meal.

673
00:40:21,492 --> 00:40:22,743
Let's go.

674
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:28,916
What are you doing?

675
00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:31,085
I'm on my way, too.

676
00:40:33,504 --> 00:40:34,797
He's adorable.

677
00:40:34,881 --> 00:40:35,882
Gosh.

678
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:48,478
Drinking milk will help.

679
00:40:50,104 --> 00:40:52,857
-But that's fattening.
-Gosh, get me two cartons of milk.

680
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,277
-Gosh, okay. Is two enough?
-Excuse me.

681
00:40:58,946 --> 00:41:00,823
Can I get an autograph?

682
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:03,367
Sure.

683
00:41:04,994 --> 00:41:05,995
Give me the paper.

684
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,081
Today's episode was really good.

685
00:41:09,165 --> 00:41:12,168
What will happen to Ji-hun and Hae-jin?

686
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:14,670
Unrequited love, probably?

687
00:41:15,463 --> 00:41:16,839
I hope they end up together.

688
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:19,717
What's your name?

689
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,552
It's Hong Yu-rin.

690
00:41:46,202 --> 00:41:47,745
That way.

691
00:42:32,146 --> 00:42:34,899
Did you stay up all night?
I heard your drama was over.

692
00:42:34,982 --> 00:42:36,067
I filmed a commercial.

693
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,861
Nice. You must have made loads of money.

694
00:42:39,445 --> 00:42:40,655
I don't know that yet.

695
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:43,366
You're getting pretty popular now.

696
00:42:43,449 --> 00:42:47,620
Shouldn't Min-jae escort this superstar
to the salon? You're the talent.

697
00:42:48,746 --> 00:42:51,124
Our agency is pretty small.

698
00:42:51,207 --> 00:42:52,959
I don't have a car.

699
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:55,837
But I'll get a car pretty soon.
It's crossing the ocean.

700
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,672
And she has an important meeting.

701
00:42:58,714 --> 00:42:59,882
Did I answer everything?

702
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:17,233
You know,

703
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:20,111
I recently started working with Do-ha.

704
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:22,947
I've been meaning to say hello to you,

705
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,073
and I'm finally here.

706
00:43:24,574 --> 00:43:25,908
Ever since he joined us,

707
00:43:25,992 --> 00:43:27,994
our sales went up.
And our brand got popular.

708
00:43:28,077 --> 00:43:30,079
The company was very happy
with my decision.

709
00:43:32,415 --> 00:43:34,375
I'm sad this will be
the last one with him.

710
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:35,543
What…

711
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:38,379
This is the last one. I see.

712
00:43:40,673 --> 00:43:42,800
All right, then.

713
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:46,220
Brands that change their models often

714
00:43:46,304 --> 00:43:49,056
might be perceived as a bit disloyal.

715
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,892
Yes, that's true, too.

716
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:53,561
Excuse me. I must get back in.
I have another appointment.

717
00:43:53,644 --> 00:43:54,520
I see.

718
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:04,614
I was in such a good mood when I came in.
And now, I'm in a shitty mood.

719
00:44:18,044 --> 00:44:19,545
Hello.

720
00:44:21,088 --> 00:44:22,465
Let's be civil.

721
00:44:23,049 --> 00:44:26,219
As an agent, you must say hello
despite your personal feelings.

722
00:44:26,302 --> 00:44:29,472
No. Being civil means
not stabbing people in their backs.

723
00:44:29,555 --> 00:44:33,059
How could you say hello to me
after what you did as if it was nothing?

724
00:44:33,142 --> 00:44:35,770
What about me? What did I do?

725
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,691
You came to me and said
you would learn from me

726
00:44:40,775 --> 00:44:42,068
and wanted me to teach you.

727
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:45,738
So I taught you the basics about people,
namely, how backstabbing they are.

728
00:44:46,572 --> 00:44:48,783
I gave you a warning,
so you could succeed.

729
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:52,078
-Do you still trust people?
-I do. I just don't trust you.

730
00:44:52,161 --> 00:44:53,746
I taught you well.

731
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:56,540
Why are you here?

732
00:44:58,417 --> 00:44:59,794
Take a wild guess.

733
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:02,922
I'm here to sign a contract
for Hye-jun's commercial.

734
00:45:03,005 --> 00:45:05,258
I told them to pay him more than Do-ha
even if it's a cent more.

735
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:07,426
If not, I told them
I wouldn't sign with them.

736
00:45:08,594 --> 00:45:13,057
It looks like my talent, Hye-jun,
has hit it big.

737
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:15,977
I doubt that they will.

738
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,354
Whether they do it or not,
mind your own business.

739
00:45:35,621 --> 00:45:36,706
Hey, Mom.

740
00:45:36,789 --> 00:45:39,333
I'll drop by at your work
later this evening.

741
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:41,544
Da-on is staying with his grandma
this weekend.

742
00:45:42,086 --> 00:45:43,296
<i>No. I have plans.</i>

743
00:45:43,879 --> 00:45:46,173
Cancel it. I told you I wanted to see you.

744
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:47,550
<i>It's been too long.</i>

745
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:49,760
I already made plans.
You can come another day.

746
00:45:49,844 --> 00:45:52,263
People are jealous of me
for having a daughter.

747
00:45:52,346 --> 00:45:53,764
<i>Poor me.</i>

748
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,808
Mom, I…

749
00:45:57,059 --> 00:45:58,728
I'm in front of my office.

750
00:45:58,811 --> 00:45:59,854
Okay.

751
00:46:01,772 --> 00:46:03,816
She doesn't know
that I quit my office job.

752
00:46:05,067 --> 00:46:07,528
We're meeting the guys today.
Should I cancel it?

753
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:09,780
No. I'll go in first.
Come in after ten minutes.

754
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:11,324
Let's go in together.

755
00:46:11,407 --> 00:46:14,118
No. I can't come to work with my client.

756
00:46:14,201 --> 00:46:15,661
But you do that with Hae-hyo.

757
00:46:15,745 --> 00:46:17,330
Our relationship is different.

758
00:46:18,664 --> 00:46:21,375
-But still, I don't care.
-I care.

759
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:23,753
But I like that you don't care.

760
00:46:36,474 --> 00:46:37,600
Hello.

761
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:40,728
I've been waiting for you
after seeing your name.

762
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:42,813
-"Can I ask you out?"
-"Can I hit you?"

763
00:46:42,897 --> 00:46:44,398
Hey.

764
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:47,735
All of us became your fans, Hye-jun.

765
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,278
Thank you.

766
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:52,782
This way, please.

767
00:46:54,909 --> 00:46:55,993
Hello.

768
00:46:57,203 --> 00:46:59,163
Su-bin, I'm almost out of this.

769
00:46:59,246 --> 00:47:00,206
Okay.

770
00:47:01,624 --> 00:47:03,959
I want smokey makeup.
I want my eyes to stand out.

771
00:47:04,043 --> 00:47:06,087
My single-eyelids don't stand out.

772
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,755
I'm doing the surgery this summer.

773
00:47:08,798 --> 00:47:10,216
I have single-eyelids, too.

774
00:47:10,299 --> 00:47:14,136
So people tell me to get the surgery,
but I don't plan to get the surgery done.

775
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,056
There's a unique charm
of having small eyes.

776
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:20,142
Having double-eyelids could make you
look attractive,

777
00:47:20,226 --> 00:47:22,353
but you can't go back
to having single-eyelids.

778
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,899
Do you want the makeup
that achieves the same effect?

779
00:47:27,608 --> 00:47:30,152
Wear this makeup
when you want to have double-eyelids.

780
00:47:30,236 --> 00:47:32,655
On other days, you don't.
You have more options, then.

781
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,659
Well, I guess you can try that.

782
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:42,456
-What do you think?
-It looks great.

783
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:45,960
Do you like it?

784
00:47:47,545 --> 00:47:48,712
No.

785
00:47:50,798 --> 00:47:51,882
I'm sorry.

786
00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:55,511
Do you want the smokey makeup?

787
00:47:55,594 --> 00:47:57,221
Do you think I have time for that?

788
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,598
You're so nosy.

789
00:47:59,682 --> 00:48:01,809
Just do the makeup I asked!

790
00:48:02,393 --> 00:48:04,270
You talked about having options.

791
00:48:04,353 --> 00:48:05,771
What is this? Look!

792
00:48:05,855 --> 00:48:09,400
I'm sorry. Let me know what you want.
And I'll do it for you.

793
00:48:10,776 --> 00:48:12,611
-Buy me a house.
-Pardon?

794
00:48:13,988 --> 00:48:15,614
You said you'd do anything for me.

795
00:48:16,198 --> 00:48:17,366
What can you do for me?

796
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,076
Why say something you can't do?

797
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:23,414
Who's the manager here?
I want to see the manager now!

798
00:48:23,497 --> 00:48:26,709
I'm right here.
Why don't you come this way?

799
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:30,296
Do your job right.

800
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:11,754
It will be more painful if she knows

801
00:49:12,755 --> 00:49:14,507
her boyfriend saw that.

802
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:27,811
Did you pick a theme for the mock trial?

803
00:49:27,895 --> 00:49:30,105
Not yet. I have a few in mind,

804
00:49:30,189 --> 00:49:31,690
but it's still under discussion.

805
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:35,236
HAE-HYO

806
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:36,612
What?

807
00:49:36,695 --> 00:49:38,697
If you're free, drop by later.

808
00:49:38,781 --> 00:49:40,366
We're celebrating for Hye-jun.

809
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:43,661
Why are you inviting me
to one of your hangouts?

810
00:49:43,744 --> 00:49:46,121
Hye-jun's girlfriend is coming.
She might be bored.

811
00:49:46,914 --> 00:49:49,416
She might feel out of place
with just the three of us.

812
00:49:50,042 --> 00:49:51,043
I've got to go.

813
00:49:53,087 --> 00:49:54,630
How considerate of him.

814
00:49:55,965 --> 00:49:58,008
-Was that Hae-hyo?
-You know my brother, too?

815
00:49:58,717 --> 00:49:59,885
Of course.

816
00:50:00,386 --> 00:50:02,680
The four of us hung out together often.

817
00:50:02,763 --> 00:50:06,141
But after I broke up with Hye-jun,
I lost contact with others too.

818
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:08,519
It sounds like they still hang out.

819
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:11,063
They are all busy, so not really.

820
00:50:11,146 --> 00:50:12,565
Hye-jun is the busiest now.

821
00:50:13,399 --> 00:50:14,650
He has a girlfriend.

822
00:50:14,733 --> 00:50:17,695
After <i>Gateway</i>, he got popular.
So they only talk on the phone.

823
00:50:17,778 --> 00:50:20,155
What does Hye-jun's girlfriend do?

824
00:50:21,532 --> 00:50:23,826
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

825
00:50:24,493 --> 00:50:26,203
I should put her on a blacklist.

826
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:32,585
Go get some fresh air and have
a cup of coffee with a lot of cream.

827
00:50:34,295 --> 00:50:35,379
Thank you.

828
00:50:35,879 --> 00:50:38,340
Don't lose Hye-jun as your client.

829
00:50:39,008 --> 00:50:41,844
If you keep it up,
he will be your best client.

830
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:44,680
Okay.

831
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,101
-Did I do well?
-Yes.

832
00:50:49,184 --> 00:50:51,478
-But I was nervous.
-I was more nervous.

833
00:50:51,562 --> 00:50:53,647
I thought you liked it, so I got scared.

834
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:55,733
But it's not that bad.

835
00:50:55,816 --> 00:50:57,484
-Seriously?
-No, I didn't mean that.

836
00:50:58,277 --> 00:50:59,528
I surprised myself, too.

837
00:50:59,612 --> 00:51:01,655
Perhaps,
I should give acting another shot.

838
00:51:02,281 --> 00:51:04,617
When you said okay
to the double-eyelid makeup,

839
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,869
I got so scared for a second.

840
00:51:06,952 --> 00:51:09,204
Gosh, she really is a smooth talker.

841
00:51:09,288 --> 00:51:11,332
I get why men are switching over to her.

842
00:51:11,415 --> 00:51:13,667
So what, then?
She's got a nasty personality.

843
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:20,090
Now that you taught her a lesson…

844
00:51:20,674 --> 00:51:21,967
When did you get here?

845
00:51:25,512 --> 00:51:26,597
Hey!

846
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,515
"She must hate me for a reason.

847
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:30,184
I should work harder."

848
00:51:30,267 --> 00:51:31,560
I tried to figure out why.

849
00:51:31,644 --> 00:51:34,938
Even when you told me you hated me
for no reason and tried to slap me,

850
00:51:35,022 --> 00:51:36,940
I had hope in someone like you.

851
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:38,067
What's your point?

852
00:51:40,402 --> 00:51:43,364
I can't work
with someone like you anymore.

853
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:44,531
I'm walking out.

854
00:51:45,157 --> 00:51:49,328
But when I do, I'll expose everything
you accused me of doing.

855
00:51:52,373 --> 00:51:54,541
I did like your makeup.

856
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:56,794
Don't be blindly loyal to your friend.

857
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:02,758
What does she mean by that?

858
00:52:04,218 --> 00:52:06,970
My goodness, look at you.
Are you okay? Oh, no.

859
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:33,664
Goodness, look at him.

860
00:52:35,874 --> 00:52:37,292
Are you hurt?

861
00:52:37,376 --> 00:52:38,627
Gosh.

862
00:52:38,711 --> 00:52:42,256
I'm just embarrassed. I'm all right.

863
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:45,384
Now that your grandson's career is
taking off, you must be happy.

864
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:47,344
Perhaps, that's why you're losing focus.

865
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:50,681
I'm in such a good mood.

866
00:52:51,306 --> 00:52:53,308
So you should focus and do a better job.

867
00:52:53,892 --> 00:52:56,687
If you improve a bit more,
you can be a professional model.

868
00:52:57,271 --> 00:52:59,273
Okay. I'll do my best.

869
00:53:03,944 --> 00:53:04,987
You're here.

870
00:53:07,781 --> 00:53:09,658
Why didn't you come to the shoot?

871
00:53:09,742 --> 00:53:11,034
Jang-gun was with you.

872
00:53:11,118 --> 00:53:13,412
You and Jang-gun aren't the same.

873
00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:16,290
Shouldn't we renew the contract
for the cosmetic commercial?

874
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:19,501
<i>You don't forget anything
that involves money, do you?</i>

875
00:53:19,585 --> 00:53:22,796
Since it's been three years,
they'll give me a raise, right?

876
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,256
<i>You got canned.</i>

877
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,634
What's that look on your face?

878
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,136
Is that a no?

879
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:31,764
<i>You're no longer in demand
by the public, you punk.</i>

880
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:34,767
Oh, right.

881
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:38,520
Call my dad and tell him
not to call my mom and to live

882
00:53:39,104 --> 00:53:40,814
a nice life with his mistress.

883
00:53:40,898 --> 00:53:42,316
And this is the last handout for him.

884
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,942
Okay.

885
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:48,530
I'll go wash up and sleep.

886
00:53:48,614 --> 00:53:51,450
I came here to see you
after filming all night long.

887
00:53:56,872 --> 00:53:59,041
LEE TAE-SU

888
00:53:59,124 --> 00:54:03,128
I never asked and I don't give a shit.

889
00:54:03,212 --> 00:54:04,630
Damn it.

890
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:08,175
Could Hye-jun end up
scoring that campaign?

891
00:54:10,844 --> 00:54:14,389
Still, a plant should be cut off
while it's a sprout

892
00:54:15,724 --> 00:54:17,142
so that it never grows.

893
00:54:17,226 --> 00:54:19,978
OUT NEWS REPORTER KIM SU-MAN

894
00:54:25,484 --> 00:54:28,111
You're a long one, aren't you?
You're endlessly long.

895
00:54:32,658 --> 00:54:35,118
You drove yourself to set today

896
00:54:35,786 --> 00:54:37,538
and successfully wrapped up filming.

897
00:54:38,038 --> 00:54:39,998
I couldn't be more grateful, My Lord.

898
00:54:42,251 --> 00:54:43,627
What put you in a good mood?

899
00:54:45,003 --> 00:54:48,298
I think you're going to land
that cosmetic campaign.

900
00:54:49,591 --> 00:54:51,885
I asked a lot for it
because it was Park Do-ha's.

901
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:55,597
At first, I didn't think you'd get it,
but the client is extremely fond of you.

902
00:54:57,266 --> 00:54:58,600
Have you read the scripts?

903
00:54:58,684 --> 00:55:00,477
Yes, and I'm interested in one.

904
00:55:00,561 --> 00:55:02,437
Gosh, I think it's the one I like, too.

905
00:55:03,105 --> 00:55:05,107
All right, then. We'll say it on three.

906
00:55:05,691 --> 00:55:06,942
One, two, three.

907
00:55:07,025 --> 00:55:08,026
-<i>The King Returns</i>.
-<i>Love and Guilt</i>.

908
00:55:09,611 --> 00:55:10,612
Why?

909
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:15,033
Do you not know how important
your next project is?

910
00:55:15,617 --> 00:55:19,246
You've put yourself on the map,
so you need to expand next.

911
00:55:19,913 --> 00:55:23,041
<i>Love and Guilt</i> features
a named writer and a named director.

912
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:27,379
You were offered this chance because
the A-list stars were all too busy.

913
00:55:27,462 --> 00:55:30,591
Min-jae, let's not value
fame over the content.

914
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:32,217
I'm still me either way.

915
00:55:32,301 --> 00:55:34,803
A romantic series
is how you score commercials

916
00:55:34,887 --> 00:55:36,013
and gain global fame.

917
00:55:37,097 --> 00:55:38,640
Period dramas won't get you far.

918
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:42,019
Even the title baffles me. <i>Love and Guilt</i>.

919
00:55:42,853 --> 00:55:44,313
Why is one guilty when in love?

920
00:55:44,396 --> 00:55:46,773
You would know
if you were experienced in love.

921
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:49,151
I probably know more than you.

922
00:55:49,234 --> 00:55:51,153
Just so you know,

923
00:55:51,236 --> 00:55:54,031
romantic series is for those
who are clueless about love.

924
00:55:57,492 --> 00:56:00,412
The cold-blooded power struggle.
I like how it's brutal.

925
00:56:00,913 --> 00:56:03,498
I also love the king
choosing his children out of need.

926
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:06,418
The power struggle within the family,

927
00:56:06,501 --> 00:56:08,670
and how they attack each other
are also good.

928
00:56:08,754 --> 00:56:11,131
Well, I'm against all of that.

929
00:56:12,674 --> 00:56:14,885
You need to do what you do best

930
00:56:14,968 --> 00:56:17,429
and assert yourself
as the nation's new heartthrob.

931
00:56:18,347 --> 00:56:20,557
Why should I
when I plan to keep on acting?

932
00:56:22,142 --> 00:56:23,310
I'm not done yet.

933
00:56:24,728 --> 00:56:27,481
Being in a period drama
won't score you any commercials.

934
00:56:28,941 --> 00:56:31,526
I want to fill my filmography
with projects I want to do

935
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:32,611
even if they fail.

936
00:56:34,363 --> 00:56:35,530
But…

937
00:56:36,114 --> 00:56:38,200
Superstar Sa, wait.

938
00:56:40,202 --> 00:56:42,955
What am I supposed to do with you?

939
00:56:43,664 --> 00:56:46,208
This isn't much. It's just a spa coupon.

940
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:48,627
Those who work at their desks

941
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:51,797
tend to have stiff necks and back pain.

942
00:56:53,257 --> 00:56:55,676
How considerate of you, Mr. Lee.

943
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,471
I love going to a spa.

944
00:57:00,472 --> 00:57:01,974
Do-ha's show starts next week.

945
00:57:02,057 --> 00:57:03,850
Well, I honestly can't wait.

946
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:08,647
However, I've been hooked on
an actor named Sa Hye-jun

947
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:09,898
who was in <i>Gateway</i>.

948
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:13,151
He made it big as a model
and now he's acting.

949
00:57:15,237 --> 00:57:16,446
Hye-jun…

950
00:57:20,158 --> 00:57:21,451
Right, Hye-jun.

951
00:57:21,952 --> 00:57:23,161
Do you know something?

952
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:25,622
I guess that's just life.

953
00:57:26,206 --> 00:57:27,291
What do you mean?

954
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:31,712
Mr. Lee, you promised
I'll be the first to know, remember?

955
00:57:31,795 --> 00:57:32,754
I won't publish it.

956
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:35,590
<i>That means you will.</i>

957
00:57:35,674 --> 00:57:37,801
Hye-jun was signed with my agency.

958
00:57:37,884 --> 00:57:41,763
Way back when he was a model for about…

959
00:57:42,472 --> 00:57:44,391
five to six years.

960
00:57:44,474 --> 00:57:47,311
Goodness. You must know him well then.

961
00:57:48,937 --> 00:57:50,897
He's currently signed with an agency
run by a woman.

962
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:52,190
She stole him away.

963
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:56,737
Just thinking about Hye-jun…

964
00:57:58,363 --> 00:57:59,740
Gosh, what's gotten into me?

965
00:58:01,283 --> 00:58:02,117
Oh, dear.

966
00:58:03,118 --> 00:58:04,369
I feel terrible, you see.

967
00:58:06,288 --> 00:58:08,040
Who knew he'd…

968
00:58:12,878 --> 00:58:15,380
Mr. Lee, do tell.

969
00:58:15,464 --> 00:58:17,090
I swear I won't publish it.

970
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,845
Have you heard of a Charlie Jung?

971
00:58:23,138 --> 00:58:26,350
Yeong-nam, why haven't you
offered to buy me a drink?

972
00:58:27,184 --> 00:58:29,561
You must be thrilled
now that Hye-jun's on a roll.

973
00:58:29,644 --> 00:58:31,146
Must I be the one to say it?

974
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:33,023
I'm even more worried now.

975
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:38,028
Things went well for him too
when he first debuted as a model.

976
00:58:39,404 --> 00:58:41,656
If this doesn't pan out for him,

977
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,950
his life will be a mess.

978
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:47,079
The situation seems different this time.

979
00:58:47,162 --> 00:58:51,083
Even Jin-ri mentioned how
the kids at school were talking about him.

980
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:53,377
My wife's saying that he's a star.

981
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,338
I saw him in the series
and he sure did look handsome.

982
00:58:56,838 --> 00:58:59,257
-He's always been good looking.
-Of course.

983
00:58:59,883 --> 00:59:02,803
-Anyway, we'll grab a drink sometime.
-No, now.

984
00:59:02,886 --> 00:59:04,262
-Really?
-Yes.

985
00:59:04,346 --> 00:59:05,806
-Okay, fine.
-Good.

986
00:59:12,437 --> 00:59:15,315
I'm here to see An Jeong-ha
of the Management Support Team.

987
00:59:15,399 --> 00:59:17,109
-Could you call her?
-Sure.

988
00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:20,112
-For our future, love and work!
-For our future, love, and work!

989
00:59:20,195 --> 00:59:21,655
Enjoy, guys.

990
00:59:25,158 --> 00:59:27,202
We're partying all night
and Hye-jun will pay.

991
00:59:27,285 --> 00:59:28,537
Got it.

992
00:59:35,419 --> 00:59:36,837
Are you kidding me?

993
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,840
You're supposed to eat,
not film a romantic scene.

994
00:59:49,266 --> 00:59:51,268
Is it because it's been a while?

995
00:59:51,351 --> 00:59:52,519
You two seem awkward.

996
00:59:52,602 --> 00:59:55,605
Why would we be
when we've known each other forever?

997
00:59:58,817 --> 01:00:00,110
JI-A

998
01:00:09,453 --> 01:00:10,412
Where are you?

999
01:00:10,495 --> 01:00:13,707
<i>With my brother and his friends.
I told you earlier.</i>

1000
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:15,083
I'd like to join you.

1001
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:17,878
<i>I'm heading home after studying all day</i>

1002
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:19,379
<i>and I'm famished.</i>

1003
01:00:19,463 --> 01:00:21,256
But Hye-jun's girlfriend is here.

1004
01:00:22,591 --> 01:00:25,302
So what? I'm going there
to see Hae-hyo and Jin-u.

1005
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:29,181
Who was that?

1006
01:00:29,264 --> 01:00:30,807
Ji-a wants to join us.

1007
01:00:31,975 --> 01:00:35,395
-So?
-I told her not to come, but…

1008
01:00:35,979 --> 01:00:38,190
I can never completely say no to her.

1009
01:00:39,149 --> 01:00:40,358
Hae-na!

1010
01:00:55,582 --> 01:00:56,500
Ji-a.

1011
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:11,932
Now, talk.

1012
01:01:13,975 --> 01:01:15,227
Once we're done here.

1013
01:01:16,144 --> 01:01:17,938
My brain is at full power

1014
01:01:18,563 --> 01:01:20,273
trying to figure it out.

1015
01:01:22,234 --> 01:01:25,987
I wonder who'll be hurt the most
if I join your dinner party.

1016
01:01:28,448 --> 01:01:30,575
You came knowing
that someone could get hurt?

1017
01:01:31,243 --> 01:01:34,621
I'm only making a guess
since you stopped me from joining you.

1018
01:01:34,704 --> 01:01:36,331
I had no ulterior motive.

1019
01:01:36,414 --> 01:01:38,291
And you hurt Hye-jun with that attitude.

1020
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:41,002
Hye-jun and I had a good run.

1021
01:01:42,045 --> 01:01:44,005
Only we would know.

1022
01:01:44,089 --> 01:01:46,007
It's why we constantly got back together.

1023
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:49,511
I get it, so just get going.
You shouldn't be here.

1024
01:01:52,347 --> 01:01:53,974
Do you like his girlfriend?

1025
01:01:55,642 --> 01:01:58,436
The person who'd be
most bothered by my presence.

1026
01:01:59,062 --> 01:02:00,397
It's his girlfriend.

1027
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:07,862
-You're not denying it.
-That's enough.

1028
01:02:08,363 --> 01:02:10,073
But I'm just getting started.

1029
01:02:10,156 --> 01:02:11,783
-Ji-a--
-You're stopping me

1030
01:02:11,866 --> 01:02:15,370
so that I won't go there
and cause any damage.

1031
01:02:15,453 --> 01:02:17,455
Don't you get that your presence
can upset people?

1032
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:20,250
That's rich coming from a guy

1033
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,419
who harbors feelings
for his friend's girl.

1034
01:02:27,924 --> 01:02:28,842
Let's go.

1035
01:02:28,925 --> 01:02:30,635
I'll prove that my presence

1036
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:33,555
won't make anyone uncomfortable.

1037
01:02:37,642 --> 01:02:38,852
<i>Where did Hae-hyo go?</i>

1038
01:02:38,935 --> 01:02:40,687
Beats me. He left without a word.

1039
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,564
Something must've come up.

1040
01:02:46,109 --> 01:02:47,360
Then let's call it a day.

1041
01:02:48,028 --> 01:02:49,487
Okay, you win.

1042
01:02:49,571 --> 01:02:51,114
I'll pay, so take your time.

1043
01:03:05,378 --> 01:03:08,006
It's been a while.
Congratulations on your career.

1044
01:03:08,089 --> 01:03:08,965
Thanks.

1045
01:03:10,342 --> 01:03:12,802
Ji-a wanted to join us, so I invited her.

1046
01:03:13,345 --> 01:03:15,388
The more the merrier
when celebrating, right?

1047
01:03:16,014 --> 01:03:16,931
Sure, thanks.

1048
01:03:18,183 --> 01:03:20,894
Hae-na, how sweet of you to cover for me.

1049
01:03:20,977 --> 01:03:23,772
She didn't invite me. I invited myself.

1050
01:03:23,855 --> 01:03:24,814
As if I care.

1051
01:03:25,857 --> 01:03:27,067
Have fun, then.

1052
01:03:36,951 --> 01:03:38,495
Where's Jeong-ha?

1053
01:03:38,578 --> 01:03:40,288
She left in a hurry to see her mom.

1054
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:47,170
<i>You quit your job?</i>

1055
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:49,756
<i>How can you do this to me?</i>

1056
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,676
<i>What's your passcode?
I'll wait for you at home.</i>

1057
01:04:27,877 --> 01:04:29,838
Who are you to glare at me?

1058
01:04:30,547 --> 01:04:31,756
What have you been up to?

1059
01:04:32,924 --> 01:04:34,092
Why did you quit?

1060
01:04:35,051 --> 01:04:36,428
Did you find a better one?

1061
01:04:37,971 --> 01:04:40,432
If you had, you would've told me.

1062
01:04:41,015 --> 01:04:43,351
Didn't you take out
a huge loan to get this place?

1063
01:04:43,435 --> 01:04:45,520
How do you expect to pay it back?

1064
01:04:45,603 --> 01:04:46,980
How can you be so reckless?

1065
01:04:49,274 --> 01:04:50,775
Let me take a breath first.

1066
01:04:52,694 --> 01:04:53,987
I knew this would happen.

1067
01:04:54,821 --> 01:04:56,781
Why did I bother to raise you well?

1068
01:04:56,865 --> 01:04:58,700
It's just like the old saying.

1069
01:04:58,783 --> 01:05:00,410
Like father, like daughter.

1070
01:05:02,871 --> 01:05:05,915
Why are you crying?
I have it worse, you know.

1071
01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:09,127
As if you know how I feel.

1072
01:05:11,254 --> 01:05:12,338
Mom.

1073
01:05:16,968 --> 01:05:19,429
Why are you poor
when you throw yourself at life?

1074
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,057
-What?
-You devoted your life to raise me?

1075
01:05:23,141 --> 01:05:24,434
Why don't I recall that?

1076
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:27,061
What I do remember though

1077
01:05:27,145 --> 01:05:29,314
is how I was forced to grow up fast.

1078
01:05:32,484 --> 01:05:34,444
Life can be ironic, don't you think?

1079
01:05:35,904 --> 01:05:38,698
The man you call
unrealistic and incompetent?

1080
01:05:39,699 --> 01:05:43,119
You spend your days looking for a chance
to insult Dad, but he's rich now.

1081
01:05:44,412 --> 01:05:46,080
That man you live with though?

1082
01:05:46,748 --> 01:05:49,375
Not even once have I thought
that he's better than Dad.

1083
01:05:49,459 --> 01:05:50,627
How dare you.

1084
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:54,339
We've been married for over ten years
and have a child between us.

1085
01:05:59,469 --> 01:06:01,679
Look at you insulting me for being poor.

1086
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:06,684
I'll get lost then,

1087
01:06:08,311 --> 01:06:09,813
so live well with your rich dad.

1088
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:50,937
JEONG-HA: ARE YOU ASLEEP?

1089
01:07:10,882 --> 01:07:12,050
Do you like it?

1090
01:07:12,968 --> 01:07:14,511
Yours will be here soon, you know.

1091
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:16,429
Are you kidding me?

1092
01:07:16,513 --> 01:07:19,516
I'm curious, that's all.
As you know, I love cars.

1093
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:20,600
Why don't you get in?

1094
01:07:23,103 --> 01:07:24,312
That should be mine.

1095
01:07:26,481 --> 01:07:27,649
Here you go.

1096
01:07:27,732 --> 01:07:29,859
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1097
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:31,903
Want a ride?

1098
01:07:32,612 --> 01:07:33,446
Sure.

1099
01:07:39,494 --> 01:07:41,663
Okay, step on it.

1100
01:07:41,746 --> 01:07:43,415
Wait, hold on!

1101
01:07:50,255 --> 01:07:52,465
Easy does it.

1102
01:08:32,297 --> 01:08:33,631
Wow.

1103
01:08:33,715 --> 01:08:35,258
You're the second to get a ride,

1104
01:08:36,885 --> 01:08:38,636
but you'll always be the first to me.

1105
01:08:39,471 --> 01:08:41,014
Jeez, that was corny.

1106
01:08:41,097 --> 01:08:43,099
You're the one who encouraged me to do it.

1107
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:45,393
I like how you listen.

1108
01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:58,323
I'd love to drive a car like this too.

1109
01:09:00,533 --> 01:09:01,826
Do you have a license?

1110
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:04,037
I got mine in college
and my driving is superb.

1111
01:09:05,622 --> 01:09:06,873
Then take the wheel.

1112
01:09:07,415 --> 01:09:08,917
No way. I'm not insured.

1113
01:09:09,501 --> 01:09:10,877
Mine will cover you.

1114
01:10:34,586 --> 01:10:35,628
What did you pray for?

1115
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,924
Nothing. What about you?

1116
01:10:41,801 --> 01:10:43,178
I prayed on your behalf.

1117
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:46,514
Me? Regarding what?

1118
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,184
Finally, I have your attention.

1119
01:10:50,101 --> 01:10:51,769
You always had it, you know.

1120
01:10:53,897 --> 01:10:55,732
You seem worried about something.

1121
01:10:58,109 --> 01:10:59,736
-Do I?
-Yes.

1122
01:11:00,653 --> 01:11:02,030
You thought I wouldn't notice?

1123
01:11:03,323 --> 01:11:04,282
No.

1124
01:11:04,949 --> 01:11:07,410
I know how busy you've been lately.

1125
01:11:12,123 --> 01:11:13,166
I'm sorry…

1126
01:11:13,917 --> 01:11:15,335
for not replying to your texts.

1127
01:11:21,174 --> 01:11:22,300
It's raining.

1128
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:24,677
So it is.

1129
01:11:40,235 --> 01:11:42,153
We must be rain-cloud magnets.

1130
01:11:43,571 --> 01:11:45,490
Yes, it rained
on the first day we met too.

1131
01:11:50,078 --> 01:11:51,913
I used to hate rainy days.

1132
01:11:53,206 --> 01:11:54,332
Do you still hate them?

1133
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,627
No. I don't even remember why I used to.

1134
01:12:07,554 --> 01:12:09,556
I bet you hate unpredictable people.

1135
01:12:13,726 --> 01:12:18,064
I feel like I'm becoming
just as unpredictable though.

1136
01:12:22,735 --> 01:12:24,862
I bet you desire a stable life.

1137
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:30,618
I don't even know if such a life exists.

1138
01:12:31,369 --> 01:12:33,329
Maybe I came up with something

1139
01:12:33,413 --> 01:12:36,833
that doesn't exist
just because I desire it.

1140
01:12:43,423 --> 01:12:44,674
What will happen to us?

1141
01:12:47,802 --> 01:12:49,304
What do you hope for?

1142
01:12:55,518 --> 01:12:56,686
I love you.

1143
01:12:58,563 --> 01:12:59,731
I love you.

1144
01:14:31,656 --> 01:14:32,949
What was that just now?

1145
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:08,025
<i>The old man told the children</i>

1146
01:15:09,235 --> 01:15:12,864
<i>to wait inside
until it was no longer raining.</i>

1147
01:15:14,449 --> 01:15:17,243
<i>Do you remember the first day we met?</i>

1148
01:15:18,703 --> 01:15:21,706
<i>We were in the rain
from the very beginning.</i>

1149
01:15:23,124 --> 01:15:26,169
<i>Grown-ups have to go outside
even in the rain.</i>

1150
01:15:28,421 --> 01:15:30,006
<i>When I'm with you though,</i>

1151
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:33,843
<i>even the rain is enjoyable.</i>

RECORD OF YOUTH

1154
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:24,769
Don't you know that Hye-jun is a star now?

1155
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:26,687
<i>Does Hye-jun know?</i>

1156
01:16:26,771 --> 01:16:28,606
I want a good relationship for us.

1157
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:31,025
I've been chosen for an advertisement.

1158
01:16:31,108 --> 01:16:32,485
Congratulations, Father.

1159
01:16:32,568 --> 01:16:34,654
<i>I cannot let Hye-jun beat me.</i>

1160
01:16:34,737 --> 01:16:36,781
You said you care about me.
Then what can you do for me?

1161
01:16:36,864 --> 01:16:40,785
How could you disappoint me
when I did all I could to support you?

1162
01:16:40,868 --> 01:16:42,787
I always tell myself
that I must be strong.

1163
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:44,455
<i>I don't want to rely on someone.</i>

1164
01:16:44,539 --> 01:16:47,250
<i>Someone of this era
who people can relate to</i>

1165
01:16:47,333 --> 01:16:48,584
<i>and find comfort in.</i>
