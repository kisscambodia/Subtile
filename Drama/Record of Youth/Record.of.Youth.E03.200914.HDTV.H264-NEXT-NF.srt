RECORD OF YOUTH

2
00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:07,705
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS AN
"EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT" AND IS SUPPORTED

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,570
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, TOURISM
AND THE KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,726
Only one of you can survive.

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,771
No, more like…
"I can only survive if I kill you."

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,608
Let's do this. You know what to do.
You guys are pros. All right.

7
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,869
Give me more intense eyes.

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:36,705
Nice.

9
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:08,445
Hye-jun, can you try to relax a little?

10
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:10,739
-Oh, sure.
-Just be natural.

11
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:14,284
-Can you blot Hye-jun's face?
-Sure.

12
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:19,831
-Thank you.
-No problem.

13
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,500
-Do I look okay?
-You have an amazing friend.

14
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,919
We were going to only interview Hae-hyo.

15
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,383
-Let's resume the shoot.
-All right, let's do this.

16
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:31,801
Let's do this!

17
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:34,429
All right. Look at the camera, please.

18
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:37,807
Great. Nice.

19
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:45,523
Hey.

20
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:47,233
Ji-hun has been discharged.

21
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:49,277
We're meeting up later. Come with me.

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,570
Later? What time?

23
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,489
Let's get changed. You should wear this.

24
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,157
Can't I just wear this?

25
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:57,786
You're meeting with the director.
You look like a punk in that outfit.

26
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:00,789
He'd never look like a punk
no matter what he wears.

27
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,166
Right? He exaggerates sometimes.

28
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,169
Can I take Hye-jun to the meeting?

29
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,504
Just get changed, okay?

30
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,757
Yes, get changed. I'm off.

31
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:12,967
See you at eight.

32
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,725
I don't think I can make it.

33
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:24,813
-Why not? Do you have plans?
-No, I just don't want to go.

34
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,898
-But why?
-I don't want to tell you.

35
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,652
Why are you acting like a teenage boy
these days?

36
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,612
Why don't you want to tell me?

37
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,614
You never told me last time.

38
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,491
I know you're trying to help me out.

39
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,451
-Then be good to me.
-But the thing is…

40
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,207
Today, it makes me feel…

41
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,836
I mean, I can't really explain it,
but something's flaring up deep inside.

42
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:51,339
Right, it's been a while
since we last fought.

43
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,133
You didn't do anything wrong though.
It's just me.

44
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:57,637
Today, I just can't take it.

45
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:01,808
My self-esteem has hit rock bottom.

46
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,185
Because I suggested you tag along?

47
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:06,813
Or because of the shoot?

48
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,817
Yes, both. And my dad.

RECORD OF YOUTH

50
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,617
EPISODE 3

51
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:30,587
You're back.

52
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:40,388
It really isn't fun at all.
I can't even hit the ball,

53
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,849
but I have to do it for business' sake.

54
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:45,727
<i>Didn't she say that she enjoys golf
more than anything else?</i>

55
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:53,151
Am I here alone? Say something.

56
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,821
You once said you enjoy golf
more than anything else.

57
00:03:57,697 --> 00:03:59,490
Right, I do enjoy it.

58
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:02,285
But you can still get sick of it
if you keep doing it.

59
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:06,497
Isn't it nice to do what you enjoy
until you get sick of it?

60
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,292
I'd just be grateful if I were you.

61
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,212
But our situations are different.

62
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,339
Just because
Hae-hyo and Hye-jun are friends,

63
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,132
it doesn't mean we're friends.

64
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,677
"Friends"? Of course, we're not.
I'm younger than you.

65
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:20,970
I mean, this isn't the US.

66
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:25,099
Well, you didn't have to
draw the line like that.

67
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:27,602
Come with me.

68
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:34,943
This one.

69
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,322
And this one.

70
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,201
This one too.

71
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:46,329
<i>She always does this. I can't hate her.</i>

72
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,747
This one is no good, right?

73
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:50,166
I'll take it. I can get it altered.

74
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:55,964
I'm not throwing them out.
I just don't love them anymore.

75
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:58,675
I wouldn't care even if you were.

76
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,886
I like how things like this
doesn't bother you.

77
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,429
I mean, it'd bother me.

78
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:04,847
Why would it bother me?

79
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,016
These are better than the clothes
that I buy.

80
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,727
Right, I like that mindset.

81
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,148
You must be upset because of Hye-jun.

82
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:17,151
If he joins the military,
his career will be over.

83
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:19,237
<i>Why is she bringing him up
all of a sudden?</i>

84
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,532
Too bad he lost to Hae-hyo, of all people.

85
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:24,993
I think Hae-hyo feels bad.

86
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:29,580
I'm not worried about him.
He'll figure out what's best for him.

87
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,500
Right, I know you have to say that.
I understand.

88
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,837
No, you'll never understand
because our situations are different.

89
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,965
I'm a very empathic person.

90
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,842
Thank you for these clothes.

91
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,303
What? You don't think I am?

92
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,514
Come on. I'm so good to you!

93
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,475
<i>You call this a good job?</i>

94
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:52,395
You said it'd be different
once I put on the dress.

95
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,399
You call this bridal makeup?

96
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,944
We discussed all the details
and decided everything together.

97
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:02,822
You said you wanted to look
natural and elegant, so I--

98
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,657
Why are you talking back to me?

99
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:06,492
I'm getting married today.

100
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,581
I'm sorry. I'll redo your makeup.

101
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,542
Should I emphasize the eyes more?

102
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:44,405
MESSAGE
SU-BIN

103
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:47,241
<i>I hope these can bring
some vicarious pleasure.</i>

104
00:06:57,877 --> 00:06:59,212
<i>You should beat Jin-ju.</i>

105
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:01,422
You should beat her at least once.

106
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,133
If you lose even with my help,

107
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:06,427
you’re a fool.

108
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,889
I am a fool indeed.

109
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:16,062
Hello.
I'm Lee Min-jae, Sa Hye-jun's manager.

110
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,855
-Oh, hello.
-This is for you.

111
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,028
Hello.
I'm Lee Min-jae, Sa Hye-jun's manager.

112
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:26,697
Please contact us
when you have another movie coming up.

113
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,408
He'll do a better job next time.

114
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,702
He's pretty good,
but he's not that well-known yet.

115
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,636
What's going on?

116
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,597
Has coming all the way here
become your new hobby or something?

117
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:55,393
I've been thinking a lot
since we came back from Milan.

118
00:07:57,228 --> 00:07:59,480
-Why are you all serious?
-I'll be your manager.

119
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:02,066
-Min-jae.
-Postpone your enlistment.

120
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,861
Taking a two-year hiatus now
will kill your career.

121
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:05,987
I've already decided.

122
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:08,990
Do you know why you didn’t get the role?

123
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,326
The director liked you at first,

124
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,746
but Hae-hyo has more followers than you.
So they went with him.

125
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,916
You lost because of popularity,
not because of your acting.

126
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,795
But that's part of your competence.

127
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,091
Trust me just this once.

128
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:32,263
I'm over 40 now, and I've finally
found something I truly enjoy doing.

129
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,353
I'm sorry, Min-jae.

130
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:42,231
Try giving your all
at least once in your life.

131
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:43,399
Get home safely.

132
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:47,653
Hye-jun, I even got
my business cards made.

133
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,868
"JJamppong Entertainment"? Seriously?

134
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,912
Yes, it sums up
what my life has been like.

135
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:58,706
It's like a representation of me.
There is no better word.

136
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,041
Who else is at JJamppong?

137
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:01,667
You're the only artist.

138
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:05,087
Forget it, then. You weren't
in your right mind when you did this.

139
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:06,672
-No, I can't do that.
-Then don't.

140
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:08,925
It's your life, so stick to your plan.

141
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:10,301
But leave me out of this.

142
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,096
Hye-jun, wait.

143
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,015
Hye-jun!

144
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:19,477
You're making a mistake!
Think again for your future's sake!

145
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:23,314
That fool! Goodness!

146
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,495
<i>I know you told me to beat her,
but I lost.</i>

147
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,496
AN JEONG-HA

148
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,039
<i>I thought you might be curious.</i>

149
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,458
<i>I was hesitant but wanted to tell you.</i>

150
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:55,179
<i>My grandpa said that sometimes,
losing is winning.</i>

151
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:56,138
SA HYE-JUN

152
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,890
<i>Which means, you won.</i>

153
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,602
<i>What are you up to now?</i>

154
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:49,984
Hey, you.

155
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:54,613
Don't come so close.
What if people see us?

156
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:57,283
Who cares?

157
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:00,953
Are you getting funny ideas?

158
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,539
What funny ideas?

159
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:06,667
Also, that's not a nice habit.

160
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:10,004
What's with that finger? Are you trying
to criticize me or something?

161
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,465
No, I'm pointing at you
because I'm talking to you.

162
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,259
I can't do that?

163
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,137
You can.

164
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,185
Do you come here often?

165
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,687
It's one of the places I visit
when I'm sad.

166
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:28,939
You're sad?

167
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:30,858
I'm feeling down.

168
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:33,152
Me too.

169
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:36,322
Thanks.

170
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,326
-For not asking why I'm feeling down.
-Why are you feeling down?

171
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,621
Do you want to drink something?

172
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:05,851
From outside, everyone looks so happy.

173
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,853
I said we should drink something inside.

174
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:11,065
I said everyone "looks" happy.
I never said they're actually happy.

175
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:14,485
Buying coffee is such a waste of money.

176
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,778
It's too expensive.

177
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,406
I said I'd treat you.
It's my money, not yours.

178
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,366
Either way, I just hate wasting money.

179
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,994
You seem very comfortable
talking about money.

180
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:25,663
Most people aren't.

181
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,832
Money is like poop.

182
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:32,002
It's a difficult topic to bring up,
but you're screwed if there's a problem.

183
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:35,589
It sounds like you're speaking
from experience. Am I wrong?

184
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:41,887
RECEIPT

185
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,140
Gosh, again?

186
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:51,147
Hello, Mr. Kim.
This is An Jeong-ha from the support team.

187
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,108
We're missing the receipt from
your transaction at Jangmo BBQ,

188
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,860
on October 8. A total of 97,000 won.

189
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:59,196
You must submit a receipt for anything
over 30,000 won. I've told you.

190
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:04,160
No, I can't. The deadline is today.
Find the receipt, please.

191
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,998
People are so irresponsible
when it's not their money.

192
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,257
-Jeong-ha.
-Sir.

193
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,469
About Mr. Kim's receipt…
Just write it off for him.

194
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,471
Gosh, please don't be like this.

195
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,473
Just do as you're told, will you?

196
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:29,518
Back in my day,
I always obeyed my superiors' orders.

197
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:32,563
-How dare you glare at me…
-<i>When they say, "Back in my day,"</i>

198
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,149
<i>it means they want you
to just shut up and listen.</i>

199
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,276
Back in my day,

200
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,070
I didn't get paid
for the shows that I did.

201
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,239
Kids these days are money-greedy.

202
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:46,202
Back in my day, I could never think
of leaving work on time.

203
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,370
How could you people
leave right on the dot?

204
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,998
-Show some devotion.
-We're so good at this.

205
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,375
We shouldn't do this to
people when we're older.

206
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,585
Agreed.

207
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:58,130
But I'm craving a latte now.

208
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,341
Me too, actually.

209
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,260
Shall we sit inside?

210
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,765
You don't want to waste money?

211
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,850
I'll just compromise my principles.

212
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,614
You have foam on your lips.

213
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,283
So do you.

214
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,000
Hi, Grandpa.

215
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:38,003
<i>What? What is wrong with this?</i>

216
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,807
<i>I hung up because I didn't want you
to pay an expensive phone bill.</i>

217
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,724
<i>Why call me back?</i>

218
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,810
I get 30 minutes of free video calling.

219
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,271
You don't want to see my face?

220
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,690
<i>I do, of course. Why aren't you home yet?</i>

221
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:58,649
I'll be home soon.

222
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,068
<i>By the way, have you looked into it?</i>

223
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,737
Yes, I'm still looking into it.
Gosh, you're so impatient.

224
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:07,992
<i>My day is shorter than yours.</i>

225
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,910
Stop rushing me, please.

226
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,621
This is my friend, Jeong-ha.

227
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,416
-<i>Hello, sir.</i>
-Hi.

228
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:18,836
My, what a pretty lady.

229
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,880
You can't say stuff like that these days.

230
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,924
No, it's fine. I like it
when someone tells me I'm pretty.

231
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:28,220
<i>I've never seen a woman
who doesn't like to be told she's pretty.</i>

232
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:29,722
<i>Even your grandma…</i>

233
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,308
Gosh, this means you'll go on
for at least 30 minutes.

234
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,642
<i>Okay, I'll hang up now.</i>

235
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:35,185
-<i>Bye!</i>
-Bye, take care--

236
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:37,771
Oh, he's gone.

237
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:41,567
I guess you take after your grandpa.
He's very handsome.

238
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,402
He's also tall for someone his age.

239
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,112
-Do you want to see him?
-Yes.

240
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:46,989
Let me see.

241
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,383
Isn't this too close?

242
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:10,971
Right, sorry.

243
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,019
He could've been an actor.
Why didn't he get into acting?

244
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,772
He couldn't. He was conned several times.

245
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,316
He trusts people too easily.

246
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,526
Being trusting is a good thing.

247
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,445
Those who con others are the bad ones.

248
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,781
You're pretty good at lecturing others.

249
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:31,659
Sorry. By the way,
what did he ask you to look into?

250
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:33,452
He wants to get a job.

251
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,538
Do you think it's possible?

252
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,416
You won't find anything
if you think it's impossible.

253
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,211
Good point.

254
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:49,760
-Hey, you made it.
-Hi.

255
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,220
-Hello.
-It's been a while.

256
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,513
How have you been?

257
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,602
-Hye-jun didn't tag along today?
-That's rude.

258
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:01,188
You always bring him whenever we meet up.

259
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,316
I guess we can relax and talk today, then.

260
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,359
About what?

261
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:08,570
I recommended you to my dad
as the face of our beauty brand.

262
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:09,863
My dad is on board.

263
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,824
Hi, you draft evader.

264
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,827
Don't be like that. I'll enlist soon.

265
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,787
Just like how age matters,

266
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,164
the one who enlists first
deserves more respect.

267
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,208
Pour me some drinks.

268
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,044
Is that so? All right, sir.

269
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,590
-Let me pour you one.
-Sure thing.

270
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,182
You seem to be really enjoying it.

271
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,726
I can't stop eating.

272
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,853
You've been suppressing yourself too much.

273
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,313
That's true.

274
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:45,899
I'm happy now.

275
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,110
Me too.

276
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:51,071
-Stop copying me.
-You told me to copy you.

277
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,533
We got together too late.

278
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,536
You were too young.

279
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,165
You were too busy dating other girls.

280
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,042
Gosh, you're at it again?

281
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,253
But you're my first.

282
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,256
This is also my first time

283
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,216
dating someone knowing we'll break up.

284
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:14,887
Sure.

285
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:18,390
Whatever it is,
the first time is always exciting.

286
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:21,268
Also, don't you think
it makes us become more passionate?

287
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,561
No.

288
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:23,896
You wanted this.

289
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:27,024
Don't beg me in tears
to change my mind because I won't.

290
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,321
I will never beg anyone in tears, ever.

291
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,704
-I'm leaving.
-Okay.

292
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,919
This is the script for the movie
that Hae-hyo will be shooting.

293
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,129
I think it'll be a huge hit.
It's so engaging.

294
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,048
I see.

295
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,174
<i>I never asked.</i>

296
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,218
The wardrobe for the character…

297
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,428
And I also need to help him
practice his lines.

298
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:58,972
Gosh, I have so much to do.

299
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:02,392
You know, kids these days
can take care of things on their own.

300
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,646
Do you think Hae-hyo got this role
solely on his own?

301
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,900
These days, parents need
to help their children all their lives.

302
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,985
Then there's no hope for this world.

303
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,696
How can parents possibly
help their kids with everything?

304
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,948
Are you saying I'm wrong?

305
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,534
<i>I shouldn't even live if I can't speak out</i>

306
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,036
<i>when someone says that my child
will turn out like me.</i>

307
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,288
I'm just saying
some might think differently.

308
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,374
Wrong opinions should be corrected.

309
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,875
Let me put it in simple terms.

310
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,293
Had Hye-jun been my son,

311
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,963
he would've gotten this role.

312
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:35,467
Life is like a race. You never know
who's going to win until it's over.

313
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,011
We don't know whether that role
will do him good or harm.

314
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,138
I guess time will tell.

315
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,181
Are you putting a curse on him?

316
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,100
Are you saying it may do him harm?

317
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,935
No. You said my opinion was incorrect,

318
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,812
and I'm just telling you
that is not the case.

319
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,023
Look at you getting all smart with me.

320
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,277
<i>I've just been keeping things to myself.</i>

321
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,363
<i>Because you wouldn't understand
even if I told you.</i>

322
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,367
SIS

323
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,869
Someone's calling you!

324
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,666
Oh, no!

325
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:10,586
Ms. Han!

326
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,088
My gosh…

327
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:18,260
Gosh, this is crocodile skin.
It can't get wet.

328
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,804
But crocodiles live in water.

329
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,681
Why can't it get wet?

330
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,684
Gosh, just go bring some tissues.

331
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,279
It's okay. Forget it!

332
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,411
-I'm home.
-Hey, you're back.

333
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,249
Hello, ma'am.

334
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:51,960
"Ma'am"?

335
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,004
Oh, hey. It's been a while.

336
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:55,839
Do you know her?

337
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,508
She's Hye-jun's mother.
You remember Hye-jun, right?

338
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,469
Oh, Hye-jun!

339
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:03,847
She's Hye-jun's mother?

340
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:10,062
Throw this in the recycling bin
on your way out.

341
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,189
Sure. It looks totally fine though.

342
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,484
Who wears clothes until they're worn out?

343
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,568
Can I take this?

344
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,404
What for?

345
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,324
That's none of my business.
Sure, suit yourself.

346
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,956
-Mom.
-Oh, hi.

347
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,626
Why are you out here?

348
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,795
I'll buy you those basketball shoes
you wanted.

349
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:38,340
Nice! You're becoming more generous
now that you've started working.

350
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,509
-Does it make you happy?
-It does.

351
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,470
I work for Hae-hyo's family now.

352
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,233
-Are you shocked?
-No, I just lost my grip.

353
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,779
I'm going to keep the job. I'm really
happy that I can earn money now.

354
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,282
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

355
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,744
I've had the job for three months,
and I think I can keep doing it.

356
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:10,414
I initially thought I might quit,
so I couldn't tell you.

357
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,132
I've finally found a job
that is perfect for me.

358
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,551
I love to clean and organize things,
you know.

359
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:26,930
But I can't be totally at ease
when I think about you.

360
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,809
I'll quit if the fact that I work
for your friend's family

361
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,937
as their housekeeper
makes you feel insecure.

362
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:37,441
I don't want to keep the job
if it upsets my son.

363
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,318
Mom, so you're saying

364
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,280
I'm more important to you than work?

365
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,698
Yes, of course.

366
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:47,951
But this is my life,
and you have your own.

367
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:50,871
You don't need to feel insecure
because of my life.

368
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:52,622
What should I do?

369
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,419
Give me some time to think about it.

370
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:36,458
Have you been waiting long?
Sorry, I got held up at work.

371
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,627
Oh, boy.

372
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,880
So you're done thinking?

373
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,465
What would you like me to do?

374
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:48,762
I thought about it and realized
that your life is your own,

375
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,639
so why should I be the one deciding?

376
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,768
My life gives me enough to worry about.

377
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:58,980
Hey, you're too young to say
things like that.

378
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:02,067
I'm already 16. I have a lot on my mind.

379
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:05,612
I'm starting high school next year,

380
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,489
but we're poor.

381
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:12,828
Anyway, it's your life,
so you can do whatever you want.

382
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,164
Sa Hye-jun, you rock.

383
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,792
I also love how thoughtful you are.

384
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,086
Thinking is what makes us human.

385
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,672
My son is the best.

386
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:27,342
When I grow up, I'll earn a lot of money
so you can live comfortably.

387
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:29,636
I'll do the same.

388
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:32,722
I'll give you all the support you need
so you can do what you want.

389
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,144
Liar.

390
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,606
I can't believe I duped my own son.

391
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:48,738
That was ten years ago,
but we're still struggling financially.

392
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:53,952
I wouldn't be in this mess now
if my dad were rich.

393
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,542
I'm a bad daughter.

394
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,296
Am I putting all the blame
on Mom and Dad now?

395
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,178
I miss her.

396
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,682
I miss Mom.

397
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,188
If she were alive,

398
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:24,316
I'd be so good to her.

399
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,410
What is wrong with me?

400
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:37,996
Why am I talking to myself?

401
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:43,335
Why am I becoming more and more
like my mother as I get older?

402
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:03,230
My, you're such a deft handyman.

403
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,066
You fixed that up in no time.

404
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,985
This is why you've accomplished this much

405
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,823
even without your parents' help at all.

406
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,867
Father, that's a bit of a stretch.

407
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,828
Couldn't you have
taken care of this sooner?

408
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,373
Do I have nothing to do?
Unlike you, I have a job.

409
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,167
Well, I was just saying…

410
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:28,630
I mean, in conclusion,
I just wanted to thank you.

411
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,423
Oh, hey. Ae-suk is back.

412
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:34,928
Hey, you're back.

413
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:41,017
Couldn't you come home sooner?
Look at the time!

414
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,186
Was I out playing?

415
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,397
Don't even talk to me.

416
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,946
Hey, what's with you?

417
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:55,407
How could you yell at her
for coming home late?

418
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,285
She must be exhausted
from working so late.

419
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:01,454
You're so understanding.
Why can't you be like that with me?

420
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:04,457
I'm always like this,
but your twisted mind just doesn't see it.

421
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,794
-Are you blaming me now?
-Thanks for fixing the door.

422
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:26,813
Did something happen?

423
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,192
Just tell me! How else would I know
what's going on?

424
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,485
What's the problem?

425
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:38,074
Once I start talking, you'll be screwed.

426
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,494
All right.

427
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,332
Do you want me gone? Or shall I stay here?

428
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,792
Okay, fine.

429
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,753
I'll figure it out on my own.

430
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,134
Where are you going?

431
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:58,845
Okay.

432
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:12,859
I should be patient.

433
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:15,862
Be patient.

434
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:22,911
It's raining.

435
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:25,205
Yes, it is.

436
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,207
I hate it when it rains.

437
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,168
Wait here.

438
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,223
I checked the forecast,
but it said it wouldn't rain.

439
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:45,558
But it's raining.
And now, you have an umbrella.

440
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:48,728
-What about you?
-I can take the bus from here.

441
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,313
It's not raining in my district.

442
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:55,110
How fascinating. The weather in Seoul
is different depending on the location.

443
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:02,492
Are you going to stand there?

444
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,933
You're getting rained on.

445
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:29,561
If not me, you'd get rained on.

446
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,855
That's why I bought this umbrella.

447
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,983
You're a smooth talker, aren't you?

448
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,735
Did you have an active dating life?

449
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:39,237
No, I didn't.

450
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,449
I tend to have
long and serious relationships.

451
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:45,201
I've only been in two relationships
with the same girl.

452
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:49,831
You're so eager to tell me everything,
but I didn't ask.

453
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,001
Have you ever been on a date?

454
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:54,669
Of course, I have.

455
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,761
A strong denial is an affirmation.

456
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:09,309
I had a lot of short relationships.
I tend to get bored very easily.

457
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:11,102
It wasn't your fear of getting hurt?

458
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:14,439
I can't deny that.

459
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,151
Gosh. I can't believe
we're talking about this.

460
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,280
I'm comfortable around you, too.

461
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,492
Me?

462
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:29,037
You tell me what's on your mind,
so I let my guard down.

463
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:31,790
We even talked about money.

464
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,750
And money can be a sensitive subject.

465
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,132
But why do you hate rainy days?

466
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,552
It makes me feel like I'm all alone.

467
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:49,974
I'll call you when it rains.

468
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,434
You're not alone.

469
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:55,355
You just gave me goosebumps.
That was so cheesy.

470
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:56,981
I can't listen to you anymore.

471
00:30:57,816 --> 00:30:59,943
Hey. Hey!

472
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:12,163
You didn't put away the umbrella.

473
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,374
I can always stay rational.

474
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,334
You get cold when you get wet.

475
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,629
But don't good actors think about
emotions first?

476
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:21,840
That's why your acting is…

477
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:25,343
I can't let that slide.

478
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:31,224
I'm sorry.
Gosh, I know nothing about acting.

479
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,684
I was…

480
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:37,480
It will help no matter how small it is.

481
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:04,799
Should I cover your face?

482
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:06,843
No, I'll do it.

483
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,599
-You do it, then.
-Okay.

484
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,189
That's my bus.

485
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,026
Get home safely.

486
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,950
Go. I have to see you go first.

487
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,829
Okay. I will.

488
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:34,430
Hi, Mom.

489
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:41,270
No, I haven't gotten the money yet.
I will wire it when I can.

490
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,734
It's raining. I'm at the bus stop.

491
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,322
I know I need an umbrella.

492
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,492
<i>I'm alone,
but it feels like I'm not alone.</i>

493
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:39,120
<i>This feels great.</i>

494
00:35:12,436 --> 00:35:14,897
DEPOSITED FROM FASHION PLAY
9,670,000 WON

495
00:35:28,452 --> 00:35:29,411
Hey.

496
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:32,456
I just checked the wire transfer.

497
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:35,209
I think you sent the wrong amount.
It's too much.

498
00:35:35,793 --> 00:35:37,044
Thank Mr. Jung.

499
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,839
You did a good job with the show.
He told me to give you a bonus.

500
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:59,483
When I get my makeup done by you,
it puts me in a good mood.

501
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:02,611
Thank you. I started out
later than other makeup artists.

502
00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:04,071
So compliments make me happy.

503
00:36:04,154 --> 00:36:05,239
That's nonsense.

504
00:36:05,322 --> 00:36:07,741
I started modeling at the age of 65.

505
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:09,994
Does it mean you're new to this job?

506
00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:12,955
I've been doing this for 13 years.
I'm 78 years old now.

507
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,333
Why do you sound so surprised?

508
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:18,085
I want to work for ten more years.

509
00:36:18,168 --> 00:36:20,004
I'm sure you can work until you hit 100.

510
00:36:20,087 --> 00:36:22,298
There's always a demand for senior models.

511
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,091
This is a commercial for red ginseng.

512
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:28,053
The director and I decided to go
with a powerful and trustworthy image.

513
00:36:29,263 --> 00:36:31,598
<i>By the way, have you looked into it?</i>

514
00:36:32,266 --> 00:36:33,684
Yes, I'm still looking into it.

515
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:36,312
<i>He could've been an actor.
Why didn't he get into acting?</i>

516
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:50,534
I was just about to call you.

517
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:52,828
All right.
You came out at the perfect timing.

518
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,079
Yes, I did.

519
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,751
Your mother made <i>gimbap</i>.

520
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:01,462
Gosh. She rarely makes <i>gimbap</i>
because it takes a long time.

521
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:03,547
She's being nice to me
because I got drafted.

522
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,675
What am I going to do when you're gone?
I'll miss you a lot.

523
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:07,968
Just wait 18 months.

524
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:10,054
Your 18 months

525
00:37:10,846 --> 00:37:12,890
feel like 18 years to me.

526
00:37:12,973 --> 00:37:15,976
No! You're moping. I don't like that.

527
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,895
Did you forget our motto?

528
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:20,481
"Despite the discrimination and scolding,
we'll smile."

529
00:37:20,564 --> 00:37:22,649
Yes. A smile brings good luck.

530
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:24,151
I reheated the soup. It's good.

531
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:27,321
You've got skills, Grandpa.
Anything you do turns out well.

532
00:37:27,404 --> 00:37:30,032
My gosh. You're the best.

533
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,330
You've done enough for me.
You should date.

534
00:37:36,413 --> 00:37:39,666
You should date. I want to work now.

535
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,543
I think I might have some good news.

536
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,754
Did you already get me a job?
Where is it at?

537
00:37:43,837 --> 00:37:46,715
I'm not sure yet.
I'll have to talk about it in person.

538
00:37:48,425 --> 00:37:49,718
Who are you meeting?

539
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:54,807
VICTORY

540
00:38:09,238 --> 00:38:10,280
Have you been well?

541
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:12,366
What? What brings you here?

542
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,576
I want to get my makeup done for my drama.

543
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,662
I see. Wait here.
Jin-ju will be here soon.

544
00:38:17,788 --> 00:38:19,039
There she is.

545
00:38:19,123 --> 00:38:20,249
I want you to do it.

546
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,418
No, I can't.

547
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:23,544
You're here.

548
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:25,295
-Hi.
-You didn't make an appointment.

549
00:38:25,379 --> 00:38:27,506
No, I didn't.
I want Jeong-ha to do my makeup.

550
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:29,675
She said she couldn't do it,
but why is that?

551
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,511
It's because of our salon policy.

552
00:38:32,594 --> 00:38:34,513
She's still an assistant.

553
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:42,438
Is that more important
than satisfying your client?

554
00:38:47,943 --> 00:38:50,487
Of course, our clients come first.

555
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,948
Ms. An, you can do his makeup.

556
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,867
I'm not at that level yet.

557
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:58,245
I can raise your level.
And we can change the policy.

558
00:38:58,912 --> 00:39:00,998
-Let's wash your hair first.
-This way, please.

559
00:39:04,918 --> 00:39:06,378
How could you do this to me?

560
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:10,048
Shouldn't you reflect on yourself
and figure out

561
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:13,010
why the client didn't choose you?

562
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,881
My skin feels so silky now.
It felt so dry before.

563
00:40:13,987 --> 00:40:16,448
I can tell you're good
from how you do the base makeup.

564
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:30,170
I can always spot who's good.
I knew it even before you did my makeup.

565
00:40:30,254 --> 00:40:32,422
Please don't move.

566
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:40,472
-What are you doing?
-You told me not to move.

567
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:43,767
You can breathe.

568
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:47,646
Are you feeling better now?

569
00:40:47,729 --> 00:40:49,022
What do you mean?

570
00:40:49,523 --> 00:40:52,693
You were acting distant.
You totally iced me out.

571
00:40:53,443 --> 00:40:55,112
I didn't know you knew such phrases.

572
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:58,198
Do you really think
the Internet knows me better?

573
00:40:58,282 --> 00:41:01,660
I didn't even look into you that much
because I'm not interested in you.

574
00:41:01,743 --> 00:41:03,287
That sounds like a challenge.

575
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,124
Once you get to know the real me,
you'll hopelessly be in love with me.

576
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:10,502
Is that so? How scary.

577
00:41:11,003 --> 00:41:13,922
I will never get to know the real you
in this life.

578
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:16,967
Do you only want to know Hye-jun?

579
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,137
No. I already know enough about him.

580
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,806
I bet you like him even more now.
I know how great he is.

581
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:25,809
I liked him a lot even before we met.
I was his fan.

582
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:29,521
Right. You probably like him even more
now that you've met him.

583
00:41:29,605 --> 00:41:31,148
Right. I do like him more.

584
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:34,401
So I'm trying
not to develop feelings for him.

585
00:41:35,652 --> 00:41:37,696
Just follow your heart.
Why would you do that?

586
00:41:37,779 --> 00:41:40,741
Being someone's fan is beautiful
when they don't exist in your world.

587
00:41:40,824 --> 00:41:43,577
When your fantasy and reality crash,
it becomes a mess.

588
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,582
It'd be fun to see that mess.

589
00:42:00,302 --> 00:42:01,428
Hello.

590
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:02,596
Where's Jeong-ha?

591
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:04,222
She's over there.

592
00:42:08,477 --> 00:42:10,312
Did you like your makeup today?

593
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:13,649
You were kind enough to let me choose
my own makeup artist. Thank you.

594
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:15,484
I should thank you.

595
00:42:16,068 --> 00:42:17,611
Well done, Ms. An.

596
00:42:20,822 --> 00:42:21,823
What?

597
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:23,617
What are you doing here?

598
00:42:24,117 --> 00:42:25,744
I should ask you the same thing.

599
00:42:25,827 --> 00:42:27,120
Why do you think I'm here?

600
00:42:27,996 --> 00:42:30,707
You guys seem like best friends.

601
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:34,127
-How long have you been friends?
-We went to the same elementary school.

602
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:36,296
Then, you must live in Hannam-dong.

603
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,589
Yes.

604
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:40,676
Both of your families are well-off.

605
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:44,304
So many celebrities these days
come from rich families.

606
00:42:44,388 --> 00:42:46,723
Before, they used to
come from poor families.

607
00:42:47,307 --> 00:42:49,643
Not everyone from Hannam-dong is rich.

608
00:42:49,726 --> 00:42:51,561
You don't have to be so modest.

609
00:42:52,145 --> 00:42:54,815
Oh, right.
What kind of tea would you like?

610
00:42:54,898 --> 00:42:56,900
-Do you have iced Americano?
-Of course.

611
00:42:57,609 --> 00:42:59,194
-I can get it for him.
-No.

612
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:02,906
A lot of my clients like me
because I know when to butt out.

613
00:43:07,577 --> 00:43:10,080
The guys missed you the other day.
What did you do?

614
00:43:10,163 --> 00:43:12,708
I should get going too.
I'll see you later.

615
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:17,546
-Are you here to see her?
-Yes. Is that the makeup for the drama?

616
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:20,340
Yes. I'll be done
with the shoot next week.

617
00:43:23,176 --> 00:43:24,511
WRITER KIM JI-HYEON

618
00:43:27,347 --> 00:43:28,640
Hey, Ji-hyeon.

619
00:43:28,724 --> 00:43:29,808
Thank you.

620
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,687
I would like to do it since you asked.

621
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:37,107
But my agency must sign off
to be on a variety show.

622
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:40,902
I'm going to be
in Mr. Choi Se-hun's movie.

623
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:45,073
No, I don't know if it will be a hit.
We'll have to see how it goes.

624
00:43:45,615 --> 00:43:46,908
Okay. Thank you.

625
00:43:47,868 --> 00:43:50,370
I befriended her
when I was on a variety show before.

626
00:43:50,454 --> 00:43:53,415
She's the main writer now.
Back then, she was an assistant.

627
00:43:54,124 --> 00:43:55,876
A few male idol singers will be on it.

628
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:57,502
I guess she's doing a travel show.

629
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:03,091
Hey, what are you doing here? We're late.
I called. Why are you still here?

630
00:44:03,175 --> 00:44:05,177
-Sorry.
-You're here too, Hye-jun.

631
00:44:05,761 --> 00:44:08,180
-Are you on a project or something?
-No.

632
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:10,182
Then, why are you here?

633
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:13,727
Let's go. I'll call you
when I'm done with the shoot.

634
00:44:14,311 --> 00:44:15,479
Okay.

635
00:44:32,287 --> 00:44:34,164
What is this awesome job opportunity?

636
00:44:35,749 --> 00:44:37,334
You're so impatient.

637
00:45:06,947 --> 00:45:09,699
Wait, no. It's not this one.

638
00:45:16,248 --> 00:45:19,334
My gosh. Why does this keep popping up?

639
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:23,296
There. This is the one.

640
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:35,183
Gosh.

641
00:45:37,477 --> 00:45:40,272
Isn't this too close?

642
00:45:46,236 --> 00:45:47,362
So what?

643
00:45:54,703 --> 00:45:57,998
His lifelong dream was
becoming a celebrity.

644
00:45:58,081 --> 00:46:01,710
This is the best way for him
to achieve his dream at his age.

645
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:04,129
I'm not trying to help him
fulfill his dream.

646
00:46:04,212 --> 00:46:07,257
He's looking for a part-time job.
He's 71 now.

647
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,218
A lot of senior models in their 80s
are still active.

648
00:46:10,302 --> 00:46:13,555
Having that kind of physical features
at his age is a talent itself.

649
00:46:14,055 --> 00:46:15,390
No. Not this one.

650
00:46:16,808 --> 00:46:19,019
You didn't even ask your grandfather.

651
00:46:19,102 --> 00:46:21,605
You shouldn't be the one
to turn down this opportunity.

652
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:24,274
-You're funny.
-No one has told me that before.

653
00:46:24,357 --> 00:46:26,067
I'll take it as a compliment.

654
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:28,695
You're very calm when you're angry.

655
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:31,740
I understand
that you might not like my idea,

656
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:35,118
but I don't think
you can deem my idea ridiculous.

657
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,455
I've seen a lot of senior models before.

658
00:46:38,538 --> 00:46:41,333
But I've never thought
my grandpa could be one.

659
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:42,917
Maybe you didn't see it

660
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:44,753
because he's your grandpa.

661
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:46,338
Why would you say that?

662
00:46:47,213 --> 00:46:49,174
Well…

663
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,344
People change.

664
00:46:52,886 --> 00:46:55,847
He might be a different person
than you remember him to be.

665
00:46:56,723 --> 00:46:59,017
That's not much of a compelling argument.

666
00:46:59,768 --> 00:47:00,769
Then…

667
00:47:02,771 --> 00:47:03,813
How about this?

668
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,775
You say you want
the best for your grandfather,

669
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:10,445
but truthfully,
you don't think he has what it takes.

670
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:13,031
-Don't cross the line.
-The line is meant to be crossed.

671
00:47:14,741 --> 00:47:16,826
Still, this is wrong.

672
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,704
You're already half on board.

673
00:47:19,788 --> 00:47:21,122
No, I'm not.

674
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,378
Where are you going?

675
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,923
I have things to sort out.
What time do you finish work?

676
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:49,943
<i>Who is it?</i>

677
00:47:53,655 --> 00:47:55,115
What a sight.

678
00:47:55,198 --> 00:47:56,199
What…

679
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:05,041
Hold on.

680
00:48:09,379 --> 00:48:11,881
Just a second.

681
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:14,426
Have a seat.

682
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:22,100
Are you here to pick me up
after kicking me down?

683
00:48:22,183 --> 00:48:24,894
I came to give you a snack.
Your favorite red bean bread.

684
00:48:27,313 --> 00:48:28,857
Serve it.

685
00:48:30,024 --> 00:48:31,776
Bossy much?

686
00:48:43,705 --> 00:48:44,998
What is this?

687
00:48:45,081 --> 00:48:47,417
I was paid for that gig on stage.

688
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,878
-It was more than I expected.
-So?

689
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:53,131
You paid for my plane ticket to Italy
and covered my expenses.

690
00:48:57,051 --> 00:48:58,845
You're enlisting soon, so take it.

691
00:48:58,928 --> 00:49:00,680
I wasn't expecting to be reimbursed.

692
00:49:00,764 --> 00:49:02,015
That'd be wrong.

693
00:49:04,434 --> 00:49:06,019
May I give you some advice?

694
00:49:06,102 --> 00:49:07,937
No, don't. I'm sick and tired of those.

695
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:11,357
-You're not ambitious enough.
-Why bother to ask when I said no?

696
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:13,359
You actually chose a decent path.

697
00:49:13,443 --> 00:49:16,029
Being an A-list star
is the best way to hit the jackpot.

698
00:49:16,112 --> 00:49:18,323
The fame comes with money
to acquire real estate.

699
00:49:18,406 --> 00:49:20,366
You receive money
just by showing your face.

700
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,452
There isn't much
to being successful in life.

701
00:49:22,535 --> 00:49:24,496
Doing what you want,
eating delicious food,

702
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:26,080
getting married, and having kids.

703
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:27,832
It's all about enjoying your today.

704
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:31,211
Unless you're born into wealth,
you'll live poor most of your life.

705
00:49:31,294 --> 00:49:33,463
Your situation never gets better, but…

706
00:49:35,048 --> 00:49:37,217
But most don't realize it
until they're over 30.

707
00:49:38,593 --> 00:49:42,222
In our 20s, we fantasize about
living our dreams.

708
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:44,140
But the smart ones figure it out early

709
00:49:44,224 --> 00:49:46,309
that earning money
is better than wild dreams.

710
00:49:46,392 --> 00:49:49,562
However, you're still lost
in that wild dream of yours.

711
00:49:50,939 --> 00:49:53,900
Why must you star in Director Choi's film?

712
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:55,735
He's talented, I agree.

713
00:49:55,819 --> 00:49:58,530
However, he could be the wrong one,
not you.

714
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:02,283
Don't give up until
you exhaust all the possibilities.

715
00:50:03,535 --> 00:50:05,495
I can get back on track
once I'm discharged.

716
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:10,458
But who'll remember you
when people barely know you even now?

717
00:50:39,028 --> 00:50:40,321
STAY AND IT'LL BE TOO LATE

718
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:43,700
OUR YOUTH WON'T BE OVER ANY TIME SOON

719
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:49,038
<i>I couldn't explain it.</i>

720
00:50:49,122 --> 00:50:51,708
<i>But deep down in my heart,
I felt something rising up.</i>

721
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:53,418
<i>I finally figured out what it was.</i>

722
00:50:54,878 --> 00:50:58,047
<i>You and I shine in our own way.</i>

723
00:51:00,133 --> 00:51:01,467
<i>You have an amazing friend.</i>

724
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:04,262
We were going to only interview Hae-hyo.

725
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:05,805
Can I take Hye-jun to the meeting?

726
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:07,807
-Are you on a project or something?
-No.

727
00:51:07,891 --> 00:51:09,642
Then, why are you here?

728
00:51:09,726 --> 00:51:11,686
<i>I can get back on track
once I'm discharged.</i>

729
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,064
But who'll remember you
when people barely know you even now?

730
00:51:17,984 --> 00:51:21,696
<i>I fooled myself that not comparing myself
and competing against him was virtuous.</i>

731
00:51:24,324 --> 00:51:25,575
<i>Now, I have no regrets.</i>

732
00:51:35,501 --> 00:51:36,502
Are you done?

733
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:39,505
What? So you don’t even call
before you come now?

734
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:41,007
I need to do something.

735
00:51:41,925 --> 00:51:42,926
Right here?

736
00:51:44,552 --> 00:51:47,513
Can you cut my hair with the hair clipper?

737
00:51:47,597 --> 00:51:50,266
Do you want to go back
when you were seven years old?

738
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:53,353
I’m joining the military.

739
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,612
-When?
-In ten days.

740
00:52:03,237 --> 00:52:05,114
Why are you cutting your hair off today?

741
00:52:05,198 --> 00:52:06,699
Because I keep wanting to stay.

742
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,118
You sound like you're leaving for good.

743
00:52:09,202 --> 00:52:11,245
The period of service
is shorter now, right?

744
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:12,956
That's easy for you to say.

745
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:14,999
Of course it is.

746
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:18,086
Still, why cut it ten days
before your enlistment date?

747
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:21,381
Having a buzz cut will only
remind you of what's to come.

748
00:52:21,464 --> 00:52:22,799
-You're right.
-I know I am.

749
00:52:22,882 --> 00:52:24,801
You make more of an argument than earlier.

750
00:52:24,884 --> 00:52:26,344
Well, I'm a fast learner.

751
00:52:26,427 --> 00:52:28,304
You're also good at praising yourself.

752
00:52:28,388 --> 00:52:30,765
No, I'm only stating a fact.

753
00:52:31,683 --> 00:52:33,685
Anyway, you should go.
Su-bin's still here.

754
00:52:36,688 --> 00:52:38,523
Are you really Hae-hyo's fan?

755
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:42,527
-Yes, I am.
-I hate liars, you know.

756
00:52:44,237 --> 00:52:46,364
Three, two, one.

757
00:52:46,447 --> 00:52:47,824
Fine, I'm your fan, all right?

758
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:00,795
What the hell? Did he just leave?

759
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,344
Damn it.

760
00:53:14,726 --> 00:53:16,686
Mom, don't we have maple syrup?

761
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:17,979
We probably do.

762
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:19,188
I can't find it.

763
00:53:19,272 --> 00:53:21,899
Did you perhaps borrow
my small diamond stud earrings?

764
00:53:21,983 --> 00:53:24,152
-No.
-Where did they go then?

765
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:26,738
They must be here somewhere.
So where's the maple syrup?

766
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:29,240
Search the kitchen! Why do you ask?

767
00:53:29,323 --> 00:53:30,616
I want pancakes, that's why!

768
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,785
Gosh, where are my earrings?

769
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:34,162
Jeez.

770
00:53:37,623 --> 00:53:39,751
Nice. That's what I'm talking about.

771
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:42,086
This is really pretty.

772
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:44,297
Hae-na and I must have the same taste.

773
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:46,716
I can't say that for our sizes though.

774
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:49,218
-Give them to Jin-ri.
-This isn't her style.

775
00:53:49,302 --> 00:53:50,928
I should give them to my niece.

776
00:53:51,012 --> 00:53:53,639
There are some pants too,
so keep them if you like.

777
00:53:53,723 --> 00:53:55,808
Hae-hyo's mom and I
don't share the same taste.

778
00:53:55,892 --> 00:53:58,102
-I'll get them to my sister-in-law.
-Sure thing.

779
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:02,231
HAE-HYO'S MOM

780
00:54:04,776 --> 00:54:07,153
-Hello?
-Have you seen my diamond stud earrings?

781
00:54:07,737 --> 00:54:10,198
-They're probably in their spot.
<i>-They're not.</i>

782
00:54:10,823 --> 00:54:12,408
When did you place them?

783
00:54:12,992 --> 00:54:15,244
-I can't remember.
-Maple syrup!

784
00:54:15,328 --> 00:54:16,621
Where's the maple syrup?

785
00:54:16,704 --> 00:54:18,748
On the third shelf
of the fridge on the right.

786
00:54:18,831 --> 00:54:20,249
Thanks, Ms. Han.

787
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:23,252
You only care about yourself, don't you?

788
00:54:23,336 --> 00:54:25,671
<i>Gosh, where did I put them?</i>

789
00:54:26,172 --> 00:54:29,092
How about you check
the powder room or the bathroom?

790
00:54:29,175 --> 00:54:30,426
Got it.

791
00:54:33,346 --> 00:54:34,597
Goodness.

792
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,308
She calls you all the time
after misplacing her things.

793
00:54:37,391 --> 00:54:38,476
Just quit already.

794
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,937
There are plenty of other places
for you to work at.

795
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:44,732
I learned how to be a housekeeper
at her place,

796
00:54:44,816 --> 00:54:47,777
and the skills I learned there
put food on my table.

797
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,195
I'm grateful for that.

798
00:54:49,278 --> 00:54:51,030
But you hate her in some ways.

799
00:54:51,864 --> 00:54:53,157
It's not that I hate her.

800
00:54:53,866 --> 00:54:55,284
I keep comparing myself to her.

801
00:54:55,368 --> 00:54:58,663
Comparing your family to hers
will only make life depressing.

802
00:54:59,372 --> 00:55:01,874
I don't even dream
of comparing myself to her directly.

803
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:05,086
But I can't help comparing our kids.

804
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:09,549
When we were young, we were taught
to be grateful for just to have been born.

805
00:55:09,632 --> 00:55:12,135
Those days are long gone now,
so fill my glass.

806
00:55:12,218 --> 00:55:13,636
Got it.

807
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:15,471
You're charming when tipsy, you know.

808
00:55:15,555 --> 00:55:17,515
It's like seeing a different side of you.

809
00:55:22,687 --> 00:55:24,188
Ae-suk, you're here too.

810
00:55:24,272 --> 00:55:25,523
-Hi.
-You're back.

811
00:55:25,606 --> 00:55:27,108
Would you like a glass too?

812
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:28,401
Of course.

813
00:55:28,484 --> 00:55:29,902
All right.

814
00:55:30,945 --> 00:55:33,531
By the way, how did Hye-jun do
on that movie audition?

815
00:55:33,614 --> 00:55:34,824
Gosh, I almost forgot!

816
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:46,002
Can you be any denser?

817
00:55:46,085 --> 00:55:49,172
They would have told us had he made it.
Unbelievable.

818
00:55:59,724 --> 00:56:01,893
Why didn't you tell them that

819
00:56:01,976 --> 00:56:04,770
Hye-jun's enlisting
now that he failed the audition?

820
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,690
You're not the only one
who loves our kids.

821
00:56:09,942 --> 00:56:12,987
Do you think I enjoy going off at Hye-jun?

822
00:56:13,779 --> 00:56:15,781
I see you know
that you go off at him though.

823
00:56:18,826 --> 00:56:20,578
I've been in his shoes.

824
00:56:22,205 --> 00:56:23,831
I know because I've been there.

825
00:56:24,999 --> 00:56:27,960
JOY FROM DAY TO DAY

826
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:46,938
Mom.

827
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:48,272
What is it?

828
00:56:48,356 --> 00:56:50,483
-Don't you have any friends?
-I don't.

829
00:56:50,566 --> 00:56:53,653
Then hang out with Auntie
instead of following me around everywhere.

830
00:56:55,154 --> 00:56:58,824
I'm not following you around.
This is me being your manager.

831
00:56:59,659 --> 00:57:01,536
You're only hurting my reputation.

832
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,913
I seem like a mama's boy
which women loathe.

833
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:09,001
Got it. For strategic reasons,
I'll take a step back.

834
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:12,547
-So you easily accept this one.
-I hate mama's boys too.

835
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,257
It'll make you seem less desirable.

836
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,342
This is exactly why I can't hate you.

837
00:57:17,426 --> 00:57:19,095
You hated me?

838
00:57:19,178 --> 00:57:23,015
You should never feel that way about me
even if it happens involuntarily.

839
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:24,517
It makes me sad.

840
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,019
I should get myself a girlfriend fast.

841
00:57:27,103 --> 00:57:29,772
-I'm off to the salon.
-Is that where your girlfriend is?

842
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,649
You weren't paying attention, were you?

843
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:34,652
I need to go to the salon too.
I'll call Jin-ju.

844
00:57:34,735 --> 00:57:36,028
I don't go to her anymore.

845
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:38,364
Then who do you go to?

846
00:57:38,447 --> 00:57:39,323
An Jeong-ha.

847
00:57:40,741 --> 00:57:42,535
Isn't she still only an assistant?

848
00:57:42,618 --> 00:57:44,036
No, she's been promoted.

849
00:57:44,537 --> 00:57:46,914
Still, she lacks experience.

850
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:49,625
Although, she's amiable
and somewhat talented.

851
00:57:50,209 --> 00:57:51,085
So it seems.

852
00:58:08,269 --> 00:58:09,687
Wait. Are you going somewhere?

853
00:58:10,271 --> 00:58:12,189
I'm going out with some friends.

854
00:58:12,857 --> 00:58:15,860
So tell me. Is this better…

855
00:58:16,986 --> 00:58:18,321
or this?

856
00:58:19,447 --> 00:58:23,409
-This one.
-It's as if you read my mind.

857
00:58:23,492 --> 00:58:25,453
I like this one more as well.

858
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:27,622
-Grandpa.
-Yes?

859
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:29,040
Do you think you can be a model?

860
00:58:29,123 --> 00:58:30,791
-A model?
-That's right.

861
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:32,627
Of course. Why wouldn't I be able to?

862
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:46,390
Why are you laughing?
Go ahead and show me then.

863
00:58:46,474 --> 00:58:47,308
All right.

864
00:59:00,738 --> 00:59:04,158
I never really noticed it,
but you still carry yourself tall. Nice!

865
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:06,285
Of course.

866
00:59:06,369 --> 00:59:10,623
If I were your age,
I'd sign myself up to be a model too.

867
00:59:21,926 --> 00:59:25,638
…can be categorized here.

868
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:29,975
UNCHILGISAM FILM STUDIO
PRODUCER KIM

869
00:59:32,228 --> 00:59:34,647
-Hello, Mr. Kim.
<i>-You were fast to pick up.</i>

870
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:37,274
My phone was right by my side.

871
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:39,860
I was hoping to check
Mr. Sa Hye-jun's schedule.

872
00:59:40,653 --> 00:59:42,029
What for?

873
00:59:53,165 --> 00:59:55,126
I'm here for the beginner's class.

874
00:59:55,209 --> 00:59:57,795
I'm afraid the classes
are only offered to seniors.

875
00:59:57,878 --> 00:59:59,630
I know. It's for my grandfather.

876
01:00:00,131 --> 01:00:01,173
I see.

877
01:00:01,257 --> 01:00:04,343
Then, please fill out this form.

878
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:13,185
<i>I have a package for you.</i>

879
01:00:21,444 --> 01:00:23,946
What a combination this is.
Grapefruit and honey!

880
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,031
You're stalling for some reason.

881
01:00:28,451 --> 01:00:30,119
Fine, I'll cut right to the chase.

882
01:00:30,202 --> 01:00:32,121
What's this package you have for me?

883
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:37,084
<i>NORMAL PERSON</i>
DIRECTED BY CHOI SE-HUN

884
01:00:38,252 --> 01:00:40,254
Out of five scenes,
you'll be silent in two,

885
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:41,714
but will have lines in three.

886
01:00:41,797 --> 01:00:43,048
The character is memorable.

887
01:00:45,259 --> 01:00:47,928
Despite it being a small role,
the producer asked for you.

888
01:00:50,973 --> 01:00:53,017
-I'll get going then.
-You're leaving?

889
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:54,935
Why should I stay?

890
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:57,897
Shouldn't you try to convince me
or something?

891
01:00:59,148 --> 01:01:00,191
Get lost.

892
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:03,754
I detect multiple coats.

893
01:02:04,463 --> 01:02:05,464
Really?

894
01:02:05,965 --> 01:02:07,550
The building's 20 years old.

895
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:10,719
Can I just add another coat
to these walls?

896
01:02:10,803 --> 01:02:12,805
Then the space will be even smaller.

897
01:02:12,888 --> 01:02:15,140
Tearing it all down requires more money.

898
01:02:15,224 --> 01:02:17,768
A bargain was requested,
so let's go with another layer.

899
01:02:17,852 --> 01:02:19,812
Well, it's all the same to us.

900
01:02:19,895 --> 01:02:20,980
At least ask though.

901
01:02:21,063 --> 01:02:23,274
If they want a bargain,
we'll add another layer.

902
01:02:23,357 --> 01:02:25,734
It is already too small
for a coffee shop, right?

903
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:30,489
It'll look a lot better if we tear down

904
01:02:30,573 --> 01:02:33,534
the walls and the ceiling
to go with slabs instead.

905
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,203
I'll check with the client then.

906
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,288
-Sure.
-Sure.

907
01:02:42,793 --> 01:02:44,962
The floor needs to be leveled again too.

908
01:02:45,546 --> 01:02:48,215
Water pipes, electrical wires,
and painting.

909
01:02:48,299 --> 01:02:51,510
-We'll need more hands on deck.
-Chang-min and Ho-cheol will be enough.

910
01:02:53,095 --> 01:02:53,929
What's this?

911
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:57,683
I should stop by the butcher's.
Head home first.

912
01:02:57,766 --> 01:02:59,560
To treat Gyeong-jun?

913
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:02,855
No, Hye-jun.
He should eat up before enlisting.

914
01:03:03,439 --> 01:03:06,734
I should get some pork belly
for my kids too.

915
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:08,485
-Hello.
-Welcome.

916
01:03:14,408 --> 01:03:15,451
You're home.

917
01:03:15,534 --> 01:03:16,535
Hi.

918
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:27,421
What do you need to tell me?

919
01:03:29,131 --> 01:03:30,299
Is it that obvious?

920
01:03:35,304 --> 01:03:37,181
The film studio contacted me.

921
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:40,517
-But you failed the audition.
-It's a different role.

922
01:03:40,601 --> 01:03:43,812
I'll only be in five scenes,
but I want to do it.

923
01:03:43,896 --> 01:03:47,399
You'll delay your enlistment for that?
How would that change anything though?

924
01:03:47,483 --> 01:03:49,318
Why must it lead to something else?

925
01:03:50,903 --> 01:03:52,112
It's just that…

926
01:03:52,988 --> 01:03:55,741
I don't want to see you get hurt anymore.

927
01:03:57,701 --> 01:04:00,329
Giving up takes courage too.

928
01:04:02,665 --> 01:04:04,124
I'm home.

929
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:05,417
Hey.

930
01:04:07,378 --> 01:04:08,671
-Here.
-What's that?

931
01:04:09,171 --> 01:04:10,756
Let's have bulgogi for dinner.

932
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:14,426
Hey. Aren't you even going to greet me?

933
01:04:15,135 --> 01:04:16,428
You saw me too.

934
01:04:16,512 --> 01:04:19,098
You ungrateful brat.

935
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,934
Let's hope the military
teaches you manners.

936
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:28,816
Dad.

937
01:04:29,316 --> 01:04:30,150
Yes?

938
01:04:35,531 --> 01:04:37,408
I agreed to be in a movie.

939
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:41,036
You darn imbecile!

940
01:04:48,377 --> 01:04:50,170
<i>Dad throwing the meat proves</i>

941
01:04:51,171 --> 01:04:52,673
<i>that this is crazy.</i>

942
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:56,093
I thought you had come to your senses,

943
01:04:56,176 --> 01:04:57,803
-but you're back at it.
-Honey!

944
01:04:57,886 --> 01:05:00,222
-Get over here.
-You can't live my life for me.

945
01:05:00,305 --> 01:05:01,807
What? Let go of me, darn it!

946
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:04,685
Don't just say you wish me luck,
but let me do what I want.

947
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:08,147
How is that you couldn't go a few days
without being tempted again?

948
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:10,482
Let go of me!

949
01:05:16,989 --> 01:05:18,490
There, I let go.

950
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,451
Let go of what?

951
01:05:20,534 --> 01:05:22,327
You. I'm done with you.

952
01:05:43,462 --> 01:05:50,743

RECORD OF YOUTH

954
01:06:20,594 --> 01:06:22,096
-I'll do it
-Nice!

955
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:24,890
<i>You are helping me achieve my dream.</i>

956
01:06:24,973 --> 01:06:25,974
Stay out of it.

957
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:27,976
<i>This is my fight.</i>

958
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:29,770
<i>Everything will be good for you now.</i>

959
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:31,271
Start what?

960
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:32,397
Don't even talk about that.

961
01:06:32,481 --> 01:06:34,274
When did you become my fan?

962
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:36,985
Fangirling over you was therapeutic.

963
01:06:37,069 --> 01:06:38,737
<i>You sound hyper than usual.</i>

964
01:06:38,821 --> 01:06:40,322
I talk a lot when I'm drunk.

965
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:44,535
<i>I was just doing my job because it's fun.</i>

966
01:06:45,786 --> 01:06:47,704
<i>-I believe you.
-I believe you, too.</i>
