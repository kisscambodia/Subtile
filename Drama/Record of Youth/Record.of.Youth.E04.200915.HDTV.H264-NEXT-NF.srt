00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:05,923
RECORD OF YOUTH

2
00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:07,705
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS AN
"EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT" AND IS SUPPORTED

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,042
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, TOURISM
AND THE KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

4
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:10,782
Dad.

5
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:11,783
Yes?

6
00:00:16,246 --> 00:00:18,039
I agreed to be in a movie.

7
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,960
You darn imbecile!

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,343
<i>Dad throwing the meat proves</i>

9
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:32,470
<i>that this is crazy.</i>

10
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:35,807
I thought you had come to your senses,

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,851
-but you're back at it.
-Honey!

12
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:40,395
-Get over here.
-You can't live my life for me.

13
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:41,896
What? Let go of me, darn it!

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,399
Don't just say you wish me luck,
but let me do what I want.

15
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:47,861
How is it that you couldn't go a few days
without being tempted again?

16
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:50,196
Let go of me!

17
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:56,828
There, I let go.

18
00:00:57,787 --> 00:00:58,663
Let go of what?

19
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:00,874
You. I'm done with you.

20
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:09,674
What are you staring at me for?

21
00:01:09,758 --> 00:01:12,635
I let go as you wished,
so do whatever you want.

22
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,846
I'll do whatever I want as well.

23
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:17,390
And what exactly would that be?

24
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:19,559
As if you care about what I want to do.

25
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:24,564
Where do you think you're going?
We're not done here.

26
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:27,067
Go to your room.
Your dad and I need to talk.

27
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:29,569
Who should I listen to?

28
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:30,820
-Me.
-Me.

29
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:33,448
I'll listen to mom.

30
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:36,117
That sneaky little brat.

31
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,621
I like that he isn't dispirited.

32
00:01:39,704 --> 00:01:41,331
What's wrong with you?

33
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:43,208
Can't you see that this will ruin him?

34
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,043
If you let him do what he wants,

35
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:47,629
he may end up
living off other people forever.

36
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:49,798
Put that in your prayers, why don't you?

37
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:52,342
How can you say that as his parent?

38
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:54,177
I only worry because I'm his father.

39
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,262
That's a crappy way
to worry about someone.

40
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:59,849
Who will believe in our children
if we don't believe in them? Look outside.

41
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:03,019
There is a long line of people
waiting to criticize them.

42
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:06,231
But he's a man.
He must marry and provide for his family.

43
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:07,482
That's not an easy task.

44
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:10,110
Why is it only a man's job
to provide for his family?

45
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:13,321
Are you saying that you provide for me?
I work for a living too.

46
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:17,742
Where on earth would he find
and marry someone like you?

47
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:20,745
You lucked out yourself, so why can't he?

48
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,791
I want to let Hye-jun choose his own path.

49
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:27,877
Just like you said, it could ruin him.

50
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:31,214
But at least he would have
the chance to do what he likes.

51
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:34,133
Have you lived your life
doing what pleases you?

52
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:36,261
No one can live
by only doing what they want.

53
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:37,679
Life isn't a joke, you know.

54
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:40,056
You were a smart kid
who received good grades.

55
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,685
But you spent all of your adulthood
only focusing on earning money.

56
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:47,355
Let's…

57
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:50,900
Let's give our children
some space to breathe.

58
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:53,111
It's the only reason I'm working.

59
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:56,531
I may have to do manual labor
until the day I die,

60
00:02:57,031 --> 00:03:00,076
but I want our children
to have a better life than mine.

61
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:03,121
Life rarely goes the way you plan it,

62
00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:05,165
but I don't want to be the one

63
00:03:05,248 --> 00:03:07,750
who shuts down his dream
before he gives it a chance.

64
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:10,044
I won't let you be the one either.

65
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,385
You'd better not regret it then.

66
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:20,054
Life is all about the right timing.

67
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:23,892
Don't you dare resent me
for not putting a stop

68
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:26,186
to this madness.

69
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:41,576
Why wear those to bed?

70
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:44,120
I want to look pretty in my sleep too.

71
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:46,039
You're a hard woman to understand.

72
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:48,583
Then love me instead of
trying to understand me.

73
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,003
Did Hae-na get into law school?

74
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:55,006
The results aren't out yet, but she's in.

75
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:57,467
Just like me, she got good grades.

76
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:02,305
It's not just good grades
that gets you into law school.

77
00:04:02,388 --> 00:04:03,389
What else do you need?

78
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:06,309
You leave the kids to me
and only check in from time to time,

79
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:08,353
but you should know that
there's more to it.

80
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:11,231
I have to say
that you're quite good at asserting

81
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:13,107
the role you play in this family.

82
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:16,361
-Must you be so mean all the time?
-You should be used to it by now.

83
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:17,737
It bothers me more now that I'm older.

84
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,531
I endure everything
that bothers me too, you know.

85
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:22,784
I'm jealous of the happy couples.

86
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:25,745
As if that changes much.

87
00:04:25,828 --> 00:04:27,705
Honestly, there's no big difference.

88
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:30,959
You're not aware of
the issue at all, are you?

89
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,127
This is why I obsess more over the kids.

90
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:36,714
Even though you do,
you'll come back to me eventually.

91
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:39,342
I do hope that day comes.

92
00:04:41,844 --> 00:04:43,054
Where are you going?

93
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:48,351
The kids aren't home yet
which means I must manage them.

94
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:11,499
What are you up to?

95
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:15,545
Mom.

96
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:20,258
What is all this?

97
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,177
Thanks.

98
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:28,641
There's no need to thank me
because I'm only being selfish.

99
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:31,310
This is so that
you don't resent me later on in life.

100
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:33,646
I could be harsher on you
than your dad, you know.

101
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:36,899
Then I love my selfish mom.

102
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:17,448
RECORD OF YOUTH

103
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,236
EPISODE 4

104
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:24,405
Wait. I almost forgot.

105
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,876
Is he disappointed by my lies

106
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:41,756
or is he burdened by the fact
that I like him?

107
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:44,675
Why hasn't he texted?

108
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:48,721
My problem is mine to solve.

109
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:56,729
I wronged him by lying,
but then I told him the truth.

110
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:58,689
That means the ball is in his court now.

111
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,943
SA HYE-JUN

112
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,948
Talk about being rude.

113
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,491
Unbelievable.

114
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,040
SA HYE-JUN

115
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:20,962
Hello?

116
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:22,964
Were you working out?

117
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:24,424
-No.
-<i>You're out of breath.</i>

118
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,092
I was just on my way out.

119
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:29,011
-Where?
-<i>Somewhere to busk.</i>

120
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:31,347
What about after that?

121
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:32,640
I'll be heading home.

122
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:33,724
<i>Got it.</i>

123
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:36,102
What exactly did you get?

124
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:39,689
Now I know that you're free,
I can ask if we could meet up.

125
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,482
<i>You could have asked me that first.</i>

126
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:44,026
I didn't want to cut
straight to the point.

127
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,820
That does seem abrupt, I guess.

128
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:47,947
<i>But I don't mind that at all.</i>

129
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,241
There's something we need to sort out.

130
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:53,119
<i>Can you afford to chat right now though?</i>

131
00:07:53,202 --> 00:07:55,288
No, I need to get going.

132
00:07:56,497 --> 00:08:00,084
By the way,
did your grandfather find work?

133
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:07,008
Are you off to see the director?

134
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:08,426
No, my manager.

135
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,304
Everything will be good for you now.

136
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:12,889
If you get to be in that movie,

137
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:16,058
you will blind everyone
and outshine the leading actor.

138
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,144
You sure are blinded by the love for me.

139
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:20,104
That's why I have a gift for you.

140
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,067
What's this?

141
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:26,486
You want to be a model.

142
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:29,197
-When did I say that?
-You said you wanted to earn money.

143
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,656
You get paid for modeling?

144
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,450
Who would hire someone like me?

145
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,869
A lot do, apparently.
We live until we're 100 now,

146
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:36,662
so you're not categorized as old.

147
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:39,499
-They say it's a blue ocean market.
-Is that so?

148
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:42,376
I have a feeling
that this is right up your alley.

149
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,296
If it doesn't pan out,
you can still socialize and exercise.

150
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:51,802
Get a refund on this.
Why spend money to play and exercise?

151
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,095
-You're scared.
-Of what?

152
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,096
Of failing.

153
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:58,351
You always say that you'd have tried it
had you been my age.

154
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:00,478
So you're scared about failing.

155
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:01,562
Right.

156
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:03,481
I love that you're honest.

157
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:04,857
You can do this, Mr. Sa.

158
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:07,235
Mr. Sa, get a refund. I can't do this.

159
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:09,779
-Request one yourself, then.
-Come on.

160
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:12,323
You're not allowed to say
that you would've succeeded

161
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:14,033
had you been my age anymore.

162
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:16,160
I don't like how strict you're being.

163
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:18,496
I'm not particularly fond
of your actions either,

164
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,456
so let's stay true to our words.

165
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,791
But, hey!

166
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:24,961
What…

167
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,963
SA MIN-GI

168
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:57,368
What brings you here unannounced?

169
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:01,998
Get in.

170
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,652
Damn, I'm done waiting. So what'll it be?

171
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:38,659
I'll do it.

172
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:43,164
Nice!

173
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:45,416
A movie star
shouldn't carry things like this.

174
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:46,876
-Stop it.
-Come on.

175
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,461
You're my artist, you know.

176
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:51,339
Others won't treat you well
if I don't treat you well myself.

177
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:52,423
I like that attitude.

178
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:56,510
Good. Then let's talk about yours.

179
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:58,554
Mine is always good.

180
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:00,014
That needs to be changed.

181
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:02,183
Be less self-centered and more objective.

182
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:04,477
That's odd.
I'm too objective if you ask me.

183
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,105
Correction.
You are too objective about yourself.

184
00:11:08,898 --> 00:11:10,358
Are you sure you know me well?

185
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:12,234
Yes, I do. I know you.

186
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:14,945
It's just that…

187
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:17,323
I didn't know you'd say yes.

188
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:18,866
It was too out of the blue.

189
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:21,202
This means I need to do it too

190
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:22,620
and I don't think I can.

191
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:25,039
I know I gave you an earful,

192
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:26,916
but you said you were giving up,

193
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:28,834
so I did too.

194
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:33,130
What?

195
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:38,219
Hilarious, right?

196
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,221
Even I find it hysterical,

197
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:41,972
but I'm also happy as hell.

198
00:11:42,598 --> 00:11:45,226
You're scaring me, you know.
Are you in your right mind?

199
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:46,769
Of course, I am!

200
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:55,111
CONTRACT

201
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,531
What I hate the most is
when people do business

202
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:00,574
solely based on
their personal relationship.

203
00:12:01,158 --> 00:12:03,661
I'm done with that too, you know.

204
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:05,663
I've been there, tried it, and failed.

205
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:07,915
Most rookies strike a 50-50 deal,

206
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:10,084
but since you need the money,

207
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:12,086
we'll divide it 70-30 in your favor.

208
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,255
It lasts seven years? That's too long.

209
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:17,133
This includes
the term you serve in the military.

210
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:20,344
This is more than a sweet deal.
Everything's in your favor.

211
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:22,555
I thought you hated
things getting personal?

212
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:25,349
I do, but I know
what you're going through.

213
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:27,935
We'll divide it 50-50
and the contract will last a year.

214
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:30,855
Anything can happen
and I won't be dead weight to you.

215
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:35,109
That gaze.

216
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:38,195
How can I go against you
when you look at me like that?

217
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,573
When it matters the most,
you always get your way.

218
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:42,700
Do I? I doubt it.

219
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:44,285
You don't? Unbelievable!

220
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,580
If only the directors knew this.

221
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:50,166
Anyway, I hear your demands,

222
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,376
so I'll draft another contract.

223
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,254
Let's get smashing!

224
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:57,631
You won't date anyway, so that's good.

225
00:12:57,715 --> 00:12:59,300
You never know.

226
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,261
I thought you were still hung up on Ji-a.

227
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:05,097
Why did you two break up anyway?
You made a nice couple.

228
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:27,036
Ji-a.

229
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,454
HYE-JUN

230
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:32,333
Just a second.

231
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:37,838
-Yes, Hye-jun.
-I came to the library to walk you home.

232
00:13:37,922 --> 00:13:40,966
Sorry, but I need to study late.

233
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,135
<i>The law school entrance exam is coming up.</i>

234
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:46,847
But you normally head home at this hour.

235
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:48,432
<i>I'm kind of in the zone today.</i>

236
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:51,769
Got it.

237
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:55,564
But I said I'm at the library,
so aren't you curious…

238
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,358
as to where I am?

239
00:14:16,585 --> 00:14:17,962
Why didn't you come up to me?

240
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:19,922
I could ask you the same thing.

241
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:22,299
You put on this show for me to witness.

242
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,176
You're making me sound mean.

243
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,136
No, I think you're a clever woman.

244
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,306
You planned this just to break up with me.

245
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:35,437
What you wanted

246
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:39,149
was for me to head home
quietly after seeing you

247
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:41,110
and deal with the pain alone.

248
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:43,112
You've changed.

249
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:44,697
I was fooled the first time,

250
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:46,657
but I won't be this time.

251
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,410
Don't doubt my love for you.

252
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,622
I'll only remember
the moments that I loved you.

253
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:14,351
You can sit here, professor.

254
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:15,603
Is Ms. An here today?

255
00:15:16,854 --> 00:15:18,230
It's her day off.

256
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:20,274
Why didn't you tell me about it?

257
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:22,109
Your manager made the call, right?

258
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:25,571
Ms. An is still a junior,
so she needs to be requested beforehand.

259
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:27,948
Besides, I'm in charge
of all our top clients.

260
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:29,617
Let Jin-ju style your hair today.

261
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,161
Please wait. I'll get back to you
after Professor Kim.

262
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:34,872
Actually, do Hae-hyo first.
He has a photoshoot soon.

263
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:36,540
I'll get my hair washed.

264
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:40,210
Go on.

265
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:43,464
Must it be no one else but Ms. An?

266
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:47,009
I see you value comfort over competence.

267
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:54,308
You know, you've been
quite talkative lately.

268
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:56,143
It doesn't seem all that professional.

269
00:15:57,311 --> 00:16:00,356
I wasn't able to enjoy tea
with my son this morning.

270
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:01,815
Could you perhaps set that up?

271
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:06,236
Of course. Please know
that I am greatly fond of you.

272
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:13,327
What's bothering you?

273
00:16:15,287 --> 00:16:18,457
I'm telling you this now
instead of waiting until we're at home

274
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,628
because I don't want
to be frustrated all day.

275
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:25,089
Jeez, you scare me.

276
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:29,468
I understand that you want
Ms. An as your makeup artist.

277
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:32,596
But if you want it to be her
and only her though,

278
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,098
you need a good enough reason.

279
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:36,141
Can't I even choose my own makeup artist?

280
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:38,018
-Do you like her?
-I do.

281
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:39,770
Why else would I request her?

282
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:42,523
So you like her as a makeup artist.

283
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:45,567
-And?
-Others won't see it that way.

284
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:47,778
You heard Jin-ju's comment just now.

285
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:49,613
Why let people gossip about you?

286
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:52,074
This is a place
where many people come and go.

287
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:54,493
-I'll change salons.
-Quitting's the easiest way out

288
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:56,036
and should be the last resort.

289
00:16:57,663 --> 00:17:01,583
Do you know why
I don't want to be in your boundary?

290
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:03,836
Because it's safe

291
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:06,922
and you're at an age that seeks danger.

292
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:12,219
What else troubles you?

293
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:14,888
I have chubby cheeks
which makes my face look big.

294
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:17,808
I see.
Then let me take care of that issue.

295
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:18,726
Let's see.

296
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,604
Here. I added shadows to your face.

297
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:25,065
I'll compare the before and after
once I'm done.

298
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,068
Everyone, go ahead and look.

299
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:29,236
JIN-JU

300
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,197
I'm sorry about this,
but can I take one phone call?

301
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:33,866
-Sure thing.
-I'm sorry.

302
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:39,872
Yes, this is Jeong-ha.

303
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:42,332
There's a staff training session
after hours today.

304
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,917
But it's my day off.

305
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:46,795
<i>I know that, but you should
attend the session.</i>

306
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:50,632
Shouldn't you have told me
about the training session yesterday?

307
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:56,930
You think you're a hotshot
now that you've been promoted.

308
00:17:57,014 --> 00:17:59,767
Just know that it only applies
to Won Hae-hyo,

309
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,227
<i>not all the clients in general.</i>

310
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:06,231
-<i>I wonder why only he requests you though.</i>
-Ma'am!

311
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:08,942
This is the only way to show you

312
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:11,737
who has seniority at the salon.
Don't you agree?

313
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,489
I can't wait all day.

314
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:14,573
Of course.

315
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,742
Well, I have plans this evening.

316
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:41,642
Jin-u, where's the catering service?

317
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:45,020
Is there an iron here?

318
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:47,940
Yes, in the office cabinet.

319
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:52,528
What are you doing
still sitting here then?

320
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:57,658
Hey, didn't you hear me?

321
00:18:57,741 --> 00:19:00,369
Traffic can delay the delivery
10 to 20 minutes.

322
00:19:03,163 --> 00:19:04,623
What the hell?

323
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:06,583
Gosh.

324
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,044
Did you seriously jump out of the way?

325
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:12,631
You should've prevented it from falling
with your own body.

326
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:15,300
Do you honestly think
that you're more valuable?

327
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:22,683
Do you have any idea
how expensive this is?

328
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:24,977
I'll pay for a new one.

329
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:29,106
I was going to
take it off your salary anyway.

330
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:32,276
Can't you properly sort out the wires?
Incompetent piece of shit.

331
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,738
Please don't swear when
you don't even pay me the minimum wage.

332
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:40,659
I'm teaching you my skills
that money can't buy you classes for.

333
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:41,869
Its monetary value--

334
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:44,371
You work all the jobs that are profitable,

335
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:46,456
-so what are you teaching me?
-Exactly that.

336
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:50,377
-Nothing's important than money.
-Then pay me my proper wage.

337
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,088
-Today will be your last day then.
-Fine.

338
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:55,632
I said today's your last day.

339
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:58,844
-You should work for now.
-I'm reporting you to the labor office.

340
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:01,180
Jin-u!

341
00:20:01,763 --> 00:20:06,602
<i>Today's my last day, so I'll get to relax</i>

342
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:09,730
<i>I'm working on my own from now on</i>

343
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:11,190
You seem happy.

344
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:13,609
Why should I be upset?

345
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:15,736
I wanted to take a break.
It all worked out.

346
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:19,072
I heard quitting is
the easiest thing in the world.

347
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:21,450
Well,

348
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:24,203
that only applies to people like you.

349
00:20:24,286 --> 00:20:25,787
I quit only after going through

350
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:28,081
thousands of moments
that made me wanted to quit.

351
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:31,126
Do you have to draw a line
between you and me like that?

352
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,880
I was humiliated in front of you.
Don't I deserve to be a bit grumpy?

353
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:43,722
I have another appointment after this.
Please wrap this up in 30 minutes.

354
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:44,932
Or I'll just leave.

355
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:50,229
-I'm leaving too.
-Jin-u.

356
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,357
I know you.

357
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,317
-What do you know?
-That you're all talk.

358
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,860
-Goodness.
-Come on.

359
00:20:57,402 --> 00:21:00,822
I'm sure you know
that I like to crack jokes.

360
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:04,534
When people laughed at what I said
earlier, I wanted to keep going.

361
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:06,328
If you want to crack jokes,

362
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:07,788
make jokes about yourself.

363
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:09,623
Why would you insult me?

364
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:11,625
Right. I get that you're mad.

365
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:16,004
Have I ever dropped honorifics to you
in front of other people?

366
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:19,007
I addressed you politely and with respect.

367
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:21,593
But whenever there are people,
you go nuts and insult--

368
00:21:21,677 --> 00:21:22,719
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:26,348
I do that because that's how I was taught.

370
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:30,519
My seniors used to kick me in the shin.
Back in my day,

371
00:21:30,602 --> 00:21:32,354
that's how people learned.

372
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:35,899
-They only paid me for transportation.
-Good for you.

373
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:37,401
So are you going to leave?

374
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:41,405
Did you just yell at me again?

375
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,700
No. I was asking you a question.

376
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,161
Jin-u, do you think you can sleep at night
after leaving me?

377
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:50,414
Yes, I can. I'll sleep like a baby.

378
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:53,417
Hold on. Wait. Jin-u.

379
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,502
If you leave like this,

380
00:21:56,086 --> 00:21:57,671
I have to stop the shoot today.

381
00:21:57,754 --> 00:21:59,256
Do you know how much I'm losing?

382
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:00,757
I don't care.

383
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,175
I'm your college alumnus.

384
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:04,636
Do you think you can find
another alum in this field?

385
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,807
I shouldn't find another one.
If I meet another alum like you again…

386
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,146
I'm going to punch that guy in the face.

387
00:22:20,068 --> 00:22:21,153
Hi.

388
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:27,492
SENIOR MODEL ACADEMY

389
00:22:31,288 --> 00:22:33,749
Excuse me. What brings you here?

390
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:37,377
Well, I…

391
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:40,422
Okay. So my grandson

392
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:44,342
got me this.

393
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:48,263
I see. You came early, sir.

394
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:50,807
The beginner's class starts next week.

395
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,311
-Here you go.
-Okay.

396
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:57,522
You and I will be in the same class.

397
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:00,567
You have a great grandson.

398
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,529
My grandchildren don't even know
what I'm up to these days.

399
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,616
<i>Why is this guy acting as if he knows me?</i>

400
00:23:10,327 --> 00:23:11,369
How old are you?

401
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,546
NEW MESSAGE

402
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,340
MIN-JAE

403
00:23:30,514 --> 00:23:32,974
<i>You're not ambitious enough.</i>

404
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:36,186
My gosh, that again.
Why don't you make a song out of it?

405
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:37,854
Let's get serious for a minute.

406
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:40,482
I'm talking about the direction
my agency should take.

407
00:23:40,982 --> 00:23:41,858
Go ahead.

408
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:44,945
The present shows a small glimpse
of your future.

409
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:47,531
The present will be your future.

410
00:23:48,031 --> 00:23:49,366
-Isn't that forcing it?
-No.

411
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:51,701
If you don't change now,
your future won't change.

412
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:55,997
I like your honesty and innocence,
but you can't defeat others with that.

413
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:58,583
Why must I do that?
I'm only competing against myself.

414
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,210
I'll win against myself.

415
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:02,212
Why would you compete against yourself?

416
00:24:02,295 --> 00:24:03,964
Why would you punch yourself?

417
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:05,966
If you get hurt,
who will cover your bills?

418
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,968
It doesn't make sense.

419
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,053
You have a point there.

420
00:24:10,137 --> 00:24:13,014
Yes, I do. You're supposed
to compete against other people.

421
00:24:14,516 --> 00:24:16,601
But I don't want to
trample on others to win.

422
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:17,853
You don't hate competing.

423
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:20,897
You won't even start because
you're scared of falling behind.

424
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,149
Overcome that fear.

425
00:24:22,232 --> 00:24:24,025
So what do you suggest that we do?

426
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,620
You're here. That's a lot of bags.

427
00:24:35,704 --> 00:24:37,080
What are you watching?

428
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:38,331
Soccer.

429
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:40,584
My manager said I wasn't ambitious enough.

430
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,544
She told me to watch the highlights

431
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:45,755
so I'll get an adrenaline rush
and get competitive.

432
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,716
I like men who aren't ambitious.

433
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,218
My gosh. I know that you like me.

434
00:24:52,262 --> 00:24:53,263
It's all right.

435
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:55,307
What? That I lied to you?

436
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:58,310
When did you become my fan?

437
00:24:58,393 --> 00:24:59,978
That arrogant look on your face.

438
00:25:00,061 --> 00:25:03,190
I should've let my fantasy stay as it is.
I shouldn't have met you.

439
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:04,608
Was meeting me disappointing?

440
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:07,986
No. I told myself that
I was a great judge of character.

441
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:09,529
You're bragging about yourself.

442
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:13,617
Of course, I should compliment myself.
I chose you out of countless celebrities.

443
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,078
And when I met you in person,
I found out you're a really good guy.

444
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:20,207
How could you be so certain
that I'm a good guy? You just met me.

445
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,709
Are you a bad guy?

446
00:25:26,254 --> 00:25:27,380
I'm a good guy.

447
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:29,883
See? I was right.

448
00:25:29,966 --> 00:25:31,343
My mom once told me

449
00:25:31,426 --> 00:25:34,554
men who call themselves bad guys
are the real bad guys.

450
00:25:34,638 --> 00:25:37,682
They can lie about everything but that.

451
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:40,268
Your mother won't meet a bad guy
since she knows that.

452
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,939
Don't you think she knows that
because she met a lot of bad guys?

453
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:45,774
Yes, I got that.

454
00:25:45,857 --> 00:25:47,317
I'm hungry.

455
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,195
-What do you want to eat?
-I don't eat out often.

456
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:51,613
Okay. Let's go.

457
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,281
Where?

458
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:55,784
You want to go to your house.

459
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:57,494
You said you don't eat out often.

460
00:25:58,245 --> 00:26:00,789
Why my house?
I might want to go to your house.

461
00:26:00,872 --> 00:26:01,998
Shall we go to my house?

462
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:21,977
What are you doing?

463
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,145
Thank you, Your Majesty.

464
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:26,273
That's too much.

465
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:29,234
I really wanted
to say something like that.

466
00:26:29,317 --> 00:26:30,944
It's comfortable now that you know.

467
00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:33,071
I shouldn't have asked if you were my fan.

468
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:36,074
I don't have some grand values in life,

469
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:38,243
but I don't want to be a liar.

470
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:40,412
Then I lied the moment we first met.

471
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:42,747
That made me feel so suffocated.

472
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:44,082
-Dig in.
-Okay.

473
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:49,212
This is good.
<i>Tteokbokki</i> is my comfort food.

474
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:57,804
Why are you patting on my back?

475
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:00,015
Is this the wrong one?

476
00:27:01,057 --> 00:27:02,225
Drink this.

477
00:27:11,901 --> 00:27:13,320
What's up with your eyes?

478
00:27:13,403 --> 00:27:15,322
-What about my eyes?
-They look too sweet.

479
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:17,991
I was just looking at you.

480
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:19,492
Good for you.

481
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:22,620
You can win over people's hearts
just by looking at them.

482
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:24,956
You sound hyper than usual.

483
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,000
It's the side effect of lying to you.

484
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:29,836
Imagine how badly
I must have wanted to meet you.

485
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,296
And I have tons to tell you.

486
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:34,507
-You can tell me everything today.
-Not when I'm sober.

487
00:27:40,221 --> 00:27:41,806
When you make a bomb shot,

488
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:46,603
the way you mix them
and the ratio are important.

489
00:27:48,646 --> 00:27:52,192
People tell me I make the best bomb shot.

490
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:57,238
You already told me that twice.

491
00:27:57,822 --> 00:27:59,199
Are you already drunk?

492
00:27:59,282 --> 00:28:02,243
How could you have such a name too?

493
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,704
I really don't know
what I should do with you.

494
00:28:04,788 --> 00:28:08,083
When you don't know what to do,
don't do anything.

495
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:09,793
Okay.

496
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:13,546
INDOOR TENT BAR

497
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,131
Why aren't you drinking?

498
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:19,010
At least one of us should stay sober
in case something happens to us.

499
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:20,679
Nothing will happen to us.

500
00:28:20,762 --> 00:28:23,473
I'm just preparing myself just in case.

501
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:26,476
You seem to complicate your life.

502
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:29,145
In that case, I'll drink some more.

503
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:30,188
It's mine.

504
00:28:31,064 --> 00:28:33,066
You said you're not drinking.

505
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:34,901
Even if I'm not, it's still mine.

506
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:36,486
I don't like losing my things.

507
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:40,073
You're not losing it.
You're giving it to me.

508
00:28:40,156 --> 00:28:42,701
You might think
mixing drinks isn't that big of a deal,

509
00:28:42,784 --> 00:28:44,703
but it's a lot of work.

510
00:28:44,786 --> 00:28:45,787
I gave it to you.

511
00:28:48,123 --> 00:28:51,751
I've never heard of a Sa except Lady Sa
in <i>Record of Lady Sa's Southward Journey.</i>

512
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:54,713
-Have you read that book?
-The soap opera of the Joseon Dynasty.

513
00:28:54,796 --> 00:28:57,090
You're even smart enough
to figure that out.

514
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:01,469
Isn't it unfair how you have the looks

515
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:03,138
and the brains?

516
00:29:03,972 --> 00:29:06,099
-Will you keep doing that?
-No.

517
00:29:09,936 --> 00:29:11,229
Sa Hye-jun.

518
00:29:13,898 --> 00:29:15,150
Sa Hye-jun.

519
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:17,736
Sa Hye-jun.

520
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:20,739
Sa Hye-jun.

521
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:23,616
Who will I forgive?

522
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:26,119
I will forgive you.

523
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:33,543
I will forgive your sins.

524
00:29:41,384 --> 00:29:42,260
You know what?

525
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:46,848
When you're having a hard time,
you pretend to be more cheerful,

526
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:49,225
so other people won't find out
how you really feel.

527
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:52,771
I know. That's what you're doing now.

528
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:56,107
You got me.

529
00:30:03,031 --> 00:30:04,783
If I were to meet you in person,

530
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:08,661
I really wanted to thank you.

531
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:32,519
You're late.

532
00:30:32,602 --> 00:30:35,021
It's midterm week soon.
I stayed behind to help

533
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:36,940
my student get ready for it.

534
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,901
The light.

535
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:41,694
You know I'm sensitive to lights.

536
00:30:41,778 --> 00:30:42,946
Okay.

537
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,245
NEW MESSAGE

538
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:53,248
MOM

539
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:55,708
<i>It's Da-on's birthday this Saturday.</i>

540
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:57,502
<i>You're his sister. Get him a present.</i>

541
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:24,404
<i>My dad is a carpenter.</i>

542
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:25,738
<i>My parents are not rich.</i>

543
00:31:26,948 --> 00:31:31,035
<i>Some people assume that we're rich
when I say we live in Hannam-dong.</i>

544
00:31:31,953 --> 00:31:33,580
<i>I have an ordinary family.</i>

545
00:31:34,455 --> 00:31:39,002
We fight and make up. We keep repeating
the cycle of fighting and making up.

546
00:31:39,544 --> 00:31:42,005
<i>Initially, I became your fan
because you were handsome.</i>

547
00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:44,757
But then, I started to emphasize with you.

548
00:31:44,841 --> 00:31:46,634
I liked that we were the same age.

549
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:49,053
Fangirling over you was therapeutic.

550
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:52,098
It feels like you're talking
about someone else, not me.

551
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:55,935
It's not you. It's the fantasy I created.

552
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:02,567
But still, thank you.

553
00:32:04,402 --> 00:32:07,906
I'm happy that I was able to help someone.

554
00:32:13,786 --> 00:32:18,333
I believe fans and stars
shouldn't have real-life relationships.

555
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:20,919
On top of that, we forged

556
00:32:21,711 --> 00:32:23,880
a new friendship out of all relationships.

557
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:25,089
I decided

558
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:28,885
to stop fangirling over you.

559
00:32:28,968 --> 00:32:30,136
I won't do it.

560
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:33,723
Gosh, I just lost a fan
when I don't have a lot to begin with.

561
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:37,393
I'm sure a lot of girls are
following you around.

562
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:41,481
Just because they follow me around,
it doesn't mean they are my fans.

563
00:32:41,564 --> 00:32:44,192
It's hard to get them to stay
with just looks.

564
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:48,988
So you know that you're handsome.

565
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,367
There was a time

566
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:54,994
when I didn't like my looks.

567
00:32:57,538 --> 00:32:58,665
Gosh.

568
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:05,004
Did you buy new shoes?

569
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:07,924
Well, yes.

570
00:33:11,094 --> 00:33:13,846
-What are you doing?
-I still think the other color--

571
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,598
No, they are better in that color.

572
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:21,104
Why are you in your brother's room?

573
00:33:21,187 --> 00:33:23,022
This is the only computer in the house.

574
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:25,733
Don't just stay home
because the exam is over.

575
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:28,736
Go and get a part-time job.
You can come to the site with me.

576
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,905
I'm looking for a part-time modeling job.

577
00:33:35,284 --> 00:33:39,706
Your handsome face worries me the most.

578
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,958
It's easy to idle your life away
with that face.

579
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:47,171
People know how precious money is
when they work their ass off for it.

580
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:51,050
You think you can do anything you want
because you get paid for just walking.

581
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:53,428
<i>Is your father handsome too?</i>

582
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:57,432
I'm not sure.
I guess you could say he's cute.

583
00:33:58,057 --> 00:33:59,100
He's short.

584
00:33:59,183 --> 00:34:01,894
Then, you must take after your grandpa.

585
00:34:01,978 --> 00:34:04,397
Yes. I resemble my mother a lot too.

586
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:08,276
Then, let me sum it up.

587
00:34:08,776 --> 00:34:10,319
Your father is

588
00:34:11,446 --> 00:34:13,614
not that handsome

589
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:15,366
and short.

590
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,994
But your mother is beautiful,

591
00:34:18,077 --> 00:34:20,204
and your grandpa is handsome, right?

592
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,706
You're so funny.

593
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:24,542
It must be hard on your father.

594
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:26,127
Why? That's not true.

595
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,756
Your father knows too well

596
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,384
about the value of having a handsome face.

597
00:34:33,468 --> 00:34:35,553
But he's refusing to see it.

598
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:36,971
Why?

599
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:38,890
Because he's not handsome.

600
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:40,224
Is he that ugly?

601
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,394
Stop it. I'm starting to like my dad.

602
00:34:43,478 --> 00:34:45,104
And I've been hating him lately.

603
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:52,862
What's going on now?

604
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:57,366
There's something I didn't tell you.

605
00:34:58,034 --> 00:34:59,035
What is it?

606
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:01,287
I talk a lot when I'm drunk.

607
00:35:02,288 --> 00:35:05,500
No. It's not serious or anything.

608
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:10,213
This behavior lasts the first 30 minutes
after I get drunk.

609
00:35:10,296 --> 00:35:14,050
I just behave a bit differently
for the first 30 minutes.

610
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:15,676
How differently?

611
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,643
Try to walk straight.

612
00:35:25,394 --> 00:35:28,564
How can I be
on a straighter path than this?

613
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:32,318
I knew it would be challenging,

614
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:35,321
but this is freaking hard!

615
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:39,158
When I quit my office job,

616
00:35:39,242 --> 00:35:42,787
I was confident that
I could make my dream come true.

617
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:46,290
You're so stupid, An Jeong-ha.

618
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:50,002
You dream when you go to sleep.

619
00:35:59,428 --> 00:36:01,264
JIN-JU

620
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:04,559
Not going to answer it?

621
00:36:05,768 --> 00:36:09,021
I can put up with everything, you know.

622
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:12,775
But the clients like me.

623
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:15,862
And they want me to do their makeup.
Why is she twisting the truth?

624
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:20,408
I was just doing my job.

625
00:36:21,492 --> 00:36:24,370
Why? Because it's fun.

626
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:27,373
But why is she making me look

627
00:36:27,456 --> 00:36:30,251
like a bitch who stole her boyfriend?

628
00:36:36,757 --> 00:36:37,967
Hey.

629
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:42,930
That's enough now.

630
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:52,899
Come on.

631
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:14,253
I think

632
00:37:15,963 --> 00:37:17,590
I must have done something wrong.

633
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:25,097
There must be a reason
behind Jin-ju's hostility toward me.

634
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:29,810
I probably gave her a reason to hate me.

635
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:38,402
No one in the world

636
00:37:38,486 --> 00:37:42,114
would bully others just for fun.

637
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,792
Your 30 minutes are up.

638
00:37:54,585 --> 00:37:56,295
It was my fault.

639
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:32,290
I will forgive your sins.

640
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:36,294
Jeong-ha.

641
00:38:57,773 --> 00:38:59,442
Are you embarrassed of me?

642
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:01,527
Yes.

643
00:39:04,947 --> 00:39:06,115
Where…

644
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:08,200
Where are you going?

645
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:11,329
Hey, wait up for me. Wait.

646
00:39:11,412 --> 00:39:13,039
Wait up.

647
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:33,661
Isn't this a nice song?

648
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:35,163
Yes, it is.

649
00:39:41,377 --> 00:39:44,547
By the way,
I really enjoy holding your hand.

650
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:50,303
But could we take things a bit further?
We're adults, you know.

651
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:54,223
I thought about that too.

652
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:55,475
You did?

653
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:56,934
Of course.

654
00:39:57,018 --> 00:39:59,979
Then, should we start today?

655
00:40:14,786 --> 00:40:16,746
I don't think it's marinated thoroughly.

656
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:19,665
I think it's pretty good.
Don't you like it, honey?

657
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:23,461
Yes. I do. I shouldn't eat
so late at night. Why did you buy this?

658
00:40:23,544 --> 00:40:25,922
You could've skipped it then.
Don't blame him.

659
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:29,383
Why hasn't Father come home yet?

660
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:31,052
It's nice that it's just us three.

661
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:33,888
Whenever I think about Grandpa
and Hye-jun, I get a headache.

662
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:35,723
Same here.

663
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:38,643
You guys make the best pair
when criticizing them.

664
00:40:38,726 --> 00:40:39,852
Of course, he's my son.

665
00:40:42,063 --> 00:40:43,189
What?

666
00:40:44,232 --> 00:40:46,025
Where were you? Why are you so late?

667
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:49,737
I'm going to start something too.

668
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:51,614
Start what?

669
00:40:52,615 --> 00:40:54,408
Can't I even talk now?

670
00:40:54,492 --> 00:40:55,785
Don't even talk about that.

671
00:40:55,868 --> 00:40:58,746
Whenever I hear you say that,
my heart skips a beat.

672
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,582
Grandpa, you're too old to start anything.

673
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:04,502
Stop stressing Dad out.
Just take it easy, please.

674
00:41:07,296 --> 00:41:08,756
Well…

675
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:12,260
Come in.

676
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:17,181
Father, can I come in?

677
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:19,392
Yes, come in.

678
00:41:22,937 --> 00:41:24,188
Did you have dinner?

679
00:41:24,814 --> 00:41:26,941
Have you ever seen me skipping a meal?

680
00:41:27,024 --> 00:41:29,986
No, never.
And I really love that about you.

681
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:32,697
I'm sure there are other things
that you love about me.

682
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,158
Father, I like you
just the way you are now.

683
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:37,076
I just want you to stay healthy.

684
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,954
Starting something new
can be stressful, you know.

685
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:42,874
Also, shouldn't you get another checkup?

686
00:41:42,957 --> 00:41:44,041
No, I'm fine.

687
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:47,628
And it's just for checking whether
the body is functioning okay or not.

688
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,674
I don't want you to fall ill, Father.

689
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:55,136
<i>Even you don't want me to do anything.</i>

690
00:41:57,597 --> 00:41:58,973
I'll be good to you.

691
00:41:59,056 --> 00:42:01,058
You're always good to me.

692
00:42:01,142 --> 00:42:02,226
Where's Hye-jun?

693
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,021
I'm sure he's out
doing the things that he wants to do.

694
00:42:05,104 --> 00:42:07,982
I know I told him to do what he likes,
but I'm still conflicted.

695
00:42:08,065 --> 00:42:09,317
You guys…

696
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:13,154
You guys really undervalue
the importance of good looks.

697
00:42:13,946 --> 00:42:16,365
Hye-jun will make it big. I know it.

698
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:19,160
I just don't want to worry about him.

699
00:42:22,246 --> 00:42:24,373
SEODAEMUN

700
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:34,842
Oh, boy.

701
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,594
Gosh.

702
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:41,265
Hey, are you done drunk talking?

703
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:43,309
Yes, I think so.

704
00:42:44,393 --> 00:42:46,479
I don't think you are.

705
00:42:46,562 --> 00:42:48,773
No! I said I'm done.

706
00:42:53,027 --> 00:42:55,029
What? I think it's raining.

707
00:42:56,072 --> 00:42:57,365
It is raining.

708
00:42:57,448 --> 00:42:59,075
Let's run. Come on!

709
00:43:02,203 --> 00:43:03,204
-My gosh.
-Gosh.

710
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:36,529
-Over there.
-My gosh.

711
00:44:01,262 --> 00:44:03,806
I enrolled my grandpa
at a modeling academy.

712
00:44:04,765 --> 00:44:06,350
So you took my advice?

713
00:44:07,143 --> 00:44:08,227
I sure did.

714
00:44:08,853 --> 00:44:10,229
It also helped me reflect on

715
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,650
how my opinion on him wasn't any different
from others' when I said I loved him.

716
00:44:15,276 --> 00:44:18,696
I like people who reflect
on themselves and their past mistakes.

717
00:44:19,196 --> 00:44:21,365
But I don't like people
who are unpredictable.

718
00:44:22,408 --> 00:44:26,162
I like people who keep their words.
I don't like people who make me anxious.

719
00:44:27,163 --> 00:44:29,749
There's someone who's self-reflective
but unpredictable.

720
00:44:29,832 --> 00:44:31,709
He keeps promises but makes you anxious.

721
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:33,544
Then what will you do?

722
00:44:34,503 --> 00:44:35,796
I won't like him.

723
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:38,382
I guess you like disliking people.

724
00:44:42,136 --> 00:44:43,304
What do you like?

725
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,516
Even the qualities that I like
bother me sometimes.

726
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,351
I think it depends on the situation.

727
00:44:49,435 --> 00:44:51,937
When I'm in love,
I like everything about that person.

728
00:44:54,106 --> 00:44:56,442
Whoever receives your love
will be very happy.

729
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:04,909
No. Don't get me wrong, please.

730
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:07,078
I wasn't saying I want to be loved by you.

731
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:08,496
I didn't say anything.

732
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,083
I'm very picky.
I told you what I like and dislike.

733
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,960
To date me, the guy has to satisfy
all those requirements.

734
00:45:16,337 --> 00:45:17,379
That's a given.

735
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:20,257
Do you know how many people
don't think it as a given?

736
00:45:22,885 --> 00:45:23,969
Jeong-ha.

737
00:45:24,804 --> 00:45:28,390
One of the best things about you is that
you admit it when you're wrong.

738
00:45:29,767 --> 00:45:31,977
I'm sorry. I'm not that picky.

739
00:45:32,561 --> 00:45:34,188
But I'm difficult.

740
00:45:34,271 --> 00:45:36,273
An obsessive fan
with a bad drinking habit.

741
00:45:36,357 --> 00:45:39,443
Do you know what that means?

742
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:45,991
Sadness.

743
00:45:56,544 --> 00:45:59,296
I've never loved anyone in my life.

744
00:46:39,837 --> 00:46:41,088
<i>I'm in trable.</i>

745
00:46:41,172 --> 00:46:42,673
He never spells anything right.

746
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:45,009
<i>Help me.</i>

747
00:46:47,511 --> 00:46:48,429
What's going on?

748
00:46:56,979 --> 00:46:59,023
Jin-u is not picking up.
Did something happen?

749
00:46:59,106 --> 00:47:00,316
He fought with Mr. Yang.

750
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:02,526
If it's about Mr. Yang,
I'm even more confused.

751
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,153
-Why is he there?
-Right?

752
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:22,713
OBGYN CLINIC

753
00:47:24,465 --> 00:47:25,674
What's he doing?

754
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,135
What do you think? We've been fooled.

755
00:47:34,642 --> 00:47:35,976
You prick.

756
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,312
-What's up?
-I don't want to get this shot alone.

757
00:47:38,395 --> 00:47:41,023
-No one's going to shoot you.
-What are you talking about?

758
00:47:41,106 --> 00:47:43,234
You need to get beaten up to a pulp.

759
00:47:43,317 --> 00:47:45,110
Gosh, stop it.

760
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:47,071
Here.

761
00:47:47,738 --> 00:47:49,531
<i>Get vaccinated against cervical cancer.</i>

762
00:47:49,615 --> 00:47:51,700
But how?

763
00:47:51,784 --> 00:47:53,869
I don't have a cervix.

764
00:47:53,953 --> 00:47:57,414
I know, but it's effective. Do it for me.

765
00:47:57,998 --> 00:48:00,042
-Hae-na, please.
-You won't do it?

766
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:03,003
I will do it.

767
00:48:04,004 --> 00:48:07,466
I want to see those three stamps soon.

768
00:48:08,884 --> 00:48:10,177
What? Three?

769
00:48:12,096 --> 00:48:13,597
You have to get it three times.

770
00:48:14,223 --> 00:48:16,016
We're dating secretly at the moment.

771
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,519
Knowing that we might get caught,

772
00:48:18,602 --> 00:48:20,229
we should minimize other risks.

773
00:48:20,896 --> 00:48:22,940
I don't want to end up
with cervical cancer.

774
00:48:23,023 --> 00:48:25,859
I'm clean. Seriously, please believe me.

775
00:48:25,943 --> 00:48:28,445
I don't believe anything without proof.

776
00:48:28,529 --> 00:48:31,198
Those stamps will serve as proof.

777
00:48:31,282 --> 00:48:32,658
Your girlfriend sent you here?

778
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:33,701
-He has a girlfriend?
-Yes.

779
00:48:33,784 --> 00:48:35,953
-No.
-You knew? Only I didn't know?

780
00:48:36,036 --> 00:48:38,622
No. I said, no. Why believe him, not me?

781
00:48:38,706 --> 00:48:40,749
Because he thinks I'm more trustworthy.

782
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,713
Hey, this vaccine isn't only for women.

783
00:48:45,796 --> 00:48:48,507
Even if the guy gets it,
it's equally effective.

784
00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:51,010
-Break up with her.
-Why?

785
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:54,179
She's manipulating you.
You've never done this for a girl before.

786
00:48:54,263 --> 00:48:57,016
It's just a vaccine.
I said, it's not just for women.

787
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:59,226
-I think it's someone we know.
-No!

788
00:49:01,562 --> 00:49:03,272
Why yell? Is it someone we know?

789
00:49:03,355 --> 00:49:04,857
Are you seeing Hae-na?

790
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:07,192
Jeez, are you crazy?

791
00:49:09,445 --> 00:49:11,280
I guess you haven't lost your mind yet.

792
00:49:11,363 --> 00:49:14,366
You at least seem to know
that you can't date your family member.

793
00:49:14,992 --> 00:49:16,368
Mr. Sa Hye-jun?

794
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,746
-Yes?
-Please come to the treatment room.

795
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:22,333
What the hell?

796
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:24,543
You're our leader.

797
00:49:25,586 --> 00:49:27,254
The leader must do everything first.

798
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,173
You traitor.

799
00:49:29,673 --> 00:49:31,175
Betraying me, already?

800
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:39,475
-Are you next?
-No, you're next.

801
00:49:55,115 --> 00:49:56,325
<i>One, two, three.</i>

802
00:49:58,202 --> 00:49:59,536
One, two, three.

803
00:50:00,204 --> 00:50:04,625
#FRIENDSHIP #LOVE_REQUIRES_PREPARATION

804
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,423
Let's have lunch together.

805
00:50:11,507 --> 00:50:13,884
I'm meeting up with Min-jae.
Go and eat without me.

806
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:17,137
-Where are you going with Min-jae?
-She's my manager now.

807
00:50:17,221 --> 00:50:18,847
What? What does she even know?

808
00:50:18,931 --> 00:50:20,849
She knows enough to work as a manager.

809
00:50:22,476 --> 00:50:24,019
I'll speak with my agent.

810
00:50:24,812 --> 00:50:26,522
They rejected me though.

811
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,024
So no thanks.

812
00:50:33,821 --> 00:50:35,155
Hi!

813
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:37,032
I'll see you at the read-through.

814
00:50:38,242 --> 00:50:40,661
And you. I want you to stay away from me
for a while.

815
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:44,498
Bye!

816
00:50:44,581 --> 00:50:46,583
Sit in the back. The backseat.

817
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:56,969
I'm worried about him.

818
00:50:57,511 --> 00:50:59,388
He doesn't discuss things with me now.

819
00:50:59,471 --> 00:51:02,099
He always makes important decisions
on his own, you know.

820
00:51:02,182 --> 00:51:05,310
Min-jae worked as a bookkeeper
and a marketing associate.

821
00:51:05,394 --> 00:51:06,895
She can't do this kind of work.

822
00:51:06,979 --> 00:51:09,731
She knows how to manage money
and advertise. That's enough.

823
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:11,316
-You think so?
-Yes.

824
00:51:11,984 --> 00:51:13,235
Let's try to be positive.

825
00:51:13,944 --> 00:51:16,029
Anyway, I'm happy we're in the same movie.

826
00:51:16,113 --> 00:51:18,532
-Who got the lead role?
-Park Do-ha.

827
00:51:18,615 --> 00:51:20,826
Wow. It'll be a hit, without a doubt.

828
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:22,786
Director Choi Se-hun and Park Do-ha.

829
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:25,038
Hey, let's not speak too soon.

830
00:51:25,706 --> 00:51:27,624
Let's go eat something. Buy me some tripe.

831
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,751
Why should I?

832
00:51:30,836 --> 00:51:34,006
Have you forgotten
about the gift I gave you?

833
00:51:35,257 --> 00:51:36,425
How could I forget that?

834
00:51:37,426 --> 00:51:38,385
Gosh, that hurt.

835
00:51:39,178 --> 00:51:41,054
That fussy prick. He seems totally fine.

836
00:51:41,138 --> 00:51:43,599
-He's just like his sister.
-What?

837
00:51:43,682 --> 00:51:45,934
Buy me a steak. I want a steak.

838
00:51:47,978 --> 00:51:51,106
This is the classic blue I bought.
I told you about it the other day.

839
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,233
That color won't really work for us.

840
00:51:53,317 --> 00:51:56,778
I thought our celebrity clients
might need it as it's a trending color.

841
00:51:56,862 --> 00:51:58,989
Try to find more vivid colors.

842
00:51:59,656 --> 00:52:00,657
Okay.

843
00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:04,870
I'm sorry.

844
00:52:04,953 --> 00:52:07,331
I missed the training
and didn't answer your calls.

845
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,168
I was waiting for you to bring it up.

846
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,505
Look at you unabashedly admitting
that you ignored my calls.

847
00:52:15,088 --> 00:52:18,050
I knew you wouldn't come.
Of course, you wouldn't listen to me.

848
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:21,220
The director and the male clients
got your back.

849
00:52:22,054 --> 00:52:23,764
I have to say, that's a skill too.

850
00:52:24,723 --> 00:52:27,142
I wanted to be someone
who's always reachable,

851
00:52:27,226 --> 00:52:28,810
and that's how I've lived my life.

852
00:52:29,937 --> 00:52:31,939
I don't like people who are unpredictable.

853
00:52:32,523 --> 00:52:35,567
I treat others
as I would like to be treated.

854
00:52:36,068 --> 00:52:38,612
Not answering my calls
isn't that big of a deal.

855
00:52:38,695 --> 00:52:41,823
But why lecture me and talk like
you're better than everybody else?

856
00:52:42,366 --> 00:52:44,910
We just don't see eye to eye.

857
00:52:45,911 --> 00:52:48,455
Since I'm a nice person,
I'll try to be understanding.

858
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:53,001
Professor Kim
has an appointment at 11 a.m.

859
00:52:53,085 --> 00:52:55,921
It's too tight.
I have another client at 11:30 a.m.

860
00:52:57,798 --> 00:52:59,841
She'd like to get it done by Jeong-ha.

861
00:52:59,925 --> 00:53:01,009
What?

862
00:53:01,593 --> 00:53:02,719
Me? Why?

863
00:53:03,303 --> 00:53:06,014
Yes. You'd react like that, of course.

864
00:53:06,098 --> 00:53:08,600
You act like you know nothing,
but you steal my clients

865
00:53:08,684 --> 00:53:10,978
and act all naive and innocent to my face.

866
00:53:11,061 --> 00:53:12,729
I've seen many girls like you.

867
00:53:14,731 --> 00:53:15,566
Hello!

868
00:53:15,649 --> 00:53:16,900
-Hello.
-Hello.

869
00:53:16,984 --> 00:53:19,278
I'm early, aren't I?
There was no traffic at all.

870
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:21,321
-Should we wash your hair first?
-No.

871
00:53:21,405 --> 00:53:23,782
I'm going to have a word
with Jin-ju first.

872
00:53:32,457 --> 00:53:34,543
I hope your feelings aren't hurt.

873
00:53:34,626 --> 00:53:36,920
I just wanted to try
getting it done by Jeong-ha.

874
00:53:37,004 --> 00:53:38,964
-Of course, whatever you'd like.
-Thanks.

875
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:41,633
I'm always so comfortable
around you, Jin-ju.

876
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:44,386
-That's why I keep coming here.
-Thank you.

877
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:46,263
I'm just so curious.

878
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:49,474
I always thought my son valued competence

879
00:53:49,558 --> 00:53:51,768
over comfort.

880
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:55,188
But you said that wasn't the case.

881
00:53:55,939 --> 00:53:58,859
You're not the type
to say something like that for no reason.

882
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:01,403
So I wanted to check.

883
00:54:09,202 --> 00:54:10,871
Oh, have the sandwich.

884
00:54:10,954 --> 00:54:12,623
You have a full day today.

885
00:54:12,706 --> 00:54:15,417
The hair and makeup salon,
an interview, and two auditions.

886
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,753
I booked the salon
you mentioned the other day.

887
00:54:17,836 --> 00:54:19,087
Why bother going there?

888
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:20,922
Does the term "face genius" ring a bell?

889
00:54:21,006 --> 00:54:25,218
Maybe not an acting genius yet, but I want
you to impress them all with your looks.

890
00:54:25,302 --> 00:54:27,304
I'm playing a corporate heir in the movie.

891
00:54:27,387 --> 00:54:29,556
So for the drama,
I want a character who's poor.

892
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,517
As for dramas,
you'll only get such roles for a while.

893
00:54:32,601 --> 00:54:35,145
-Why is that?
-Protagonists in dramas are usually rich.

894
00:54:35,228 --> 00:54:36,813
For movies, it's the opposite.

895
00:54:36,897 --> 00:54:39,983
That is why you got
the corporate heir role.

896
00:54:40,525 --> 00:54:43,028
The read-through is next week.
You memorized your lines?

897
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:44,571
-I sure did.
-Great.

898
00:54:45,614 --> 00:54:48,283
-But why meet with the reporter?
-Reporters are people too,

899
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:49,660
and they also have emotions.

900
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:51,995
We should keep a healthy distance,

901
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,456
but I'm just trying to build connections
in advance.

902
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,375
You're very good at this.

903
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,919
Who'd think you've never worked
as a manager before?

904
00:54:59,002 --> 00:55:00,462
But why must I sit in the back?

905
00:55:02,422 --> 00:55:04,508
I know that no one calls you a star yet.

906
00:55:05,008 --> 00:55:06,301
But to me, you are a star.

907
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:10,555
A star should be revered.

908
00:55:11,056 --> 00:55:12,974
Expect privileges and try to be snooty.

909
00:55:13,558 --> 00:55:15,143
I want you to get used to it now

910
00:55:15,227 --> 00:55:17,771
so everyone will think
that you were born to be a star.

911
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:23,068
Pull over.

912
00:55:23,735 --> 00:55:25,320
-Why?
-Just pull over, please.

913
00:55:33,495 --> 00:55:34,621
Hey, why…

914
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,548
What are you doing?

915
00:55:46,842 --> 00:55:48,051
Let's go.

916
00:55:50,137 --> 00:55:50,971
Goodness.

917
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,657
You are helping me achieve my dream.

918
00:56:00,325 --> 00:56:01,576
I know.

919
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:04,954
When our values clash,
you'll have to respect my values.

920
00:56:06,247 --> 00:56:07,582
It depends on the situation.

921
00:56:08,082 --> 00:56:10,168
Then you can't call them your core values.

922
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:13,171
I want to stay humble and modest.

923
00:56:13,713 --> 00:56:16,508
I'm a good driver too.
You don't have to do all the driving.

924
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,384
This is…

925
00:56:19,761 --> 00:56:21,054
what I like about you.

926
00:56:21,137 --> 00:56:24,307
Perhaps I volunteered to be your manager
because you're like this.

927
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,684
But do you know
what this world is really like?

928
00:56:27,352 --> 00:56:30,522
Lee Tae-su closed the agency
after you left.

929
00:56:31,356 --> 00:56:34,234
-Did he go bankrupt?
-No, he practically hit the jackpot.

930
00:56:34,317 --> 00:56:36,611
He sold the company to A June,
got paid handsomely,

931
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:38,571
and now he's an executive director there.

932
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,077
There's no such thing as karma.

933
00:56:48,498 --> 00:56:50,583
I'll uphold my values no matter what.

934
00:56:53,419 --> 00:56:55,797
Gosh, can you please not look at me
like that?

935
00:56:56,881 --> 00:57:00,260
How can I say no
when you're staring at me with those eyes?

936
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,638
Fine, I respect your values.

937
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:06,432
But when it comes to business,

938
00:57:07,308 --> 00:57:08,601
you must respect my opinion.

939
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:11,771
I'll be your spokesperson.

940
00:57:11,855 --> 00:57:14,148
-Sounds good.
-Let's go to get your makeup done.

941
00:57:14,232 --> 00:57:15,400
Let's go!

942
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:26,536
It's done.

943
00:57:34,711 --> 00:57:36,671
I'd like to talk to you about something.

944
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,090
Sure, go ahead.

945
00:57:45,388 --> 00:57:48,349
There's a hierarchy among the staff here.

946
00:57:48,433 --> 00:57:51,352
Once can be considered an exception,
but not twice.

947
00:57:52,312 --> 00:57:54,981
Hae-hyo is an exception, but not me?

948
00:57:56,065 --> 00:57:57,650
I'm just an assistant.

949
00:57:57,734 --> 00:58:01,154
Makeup for women requires more
detailed work than makeup for men.

950
00:58:01,237 --> 00:58:04,616
I'll study hard.
If I manage to surpass Jin-ju,

951
00:58:04,699 --> 00:58:06,242
you can book with me then.

952
00:58:08,077 --> 00:58:10,079
I can see why Hae-hyo likes you.

953
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:13,124
You obviously know your place.

954
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:17,837
And that means you're smart.

955
00:58:19,464 --> 00:58:20,298
I like you.

956
00:58:22,175 --> 00:58:23,176
Thank you.

957
00:58:28,306 --> 00:58:31,267
To apply for the low-interest loan
for small businesses,

958
00:58:31,351 --> 00:58:33,519
you must submit a copy of your lease,

959
00:58:33,603 --> 00:58:37,106
proof of your business income,
and your sales reports.

960
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:38,232
And…

961
00:58:40,109 --> 00:58:43,488
Is this all? Your credit report
is missing, and it's the most important.

962
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:45,281
That's impossible. Look again.

963
00:58:45,365 --> 00:58:47,700
-You saw me checking everything.
-No, I didn't.

964
00:58:48,618 --> 00:58:49,953
All right, then. Look.

965
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,207
Here's a copy of your lease.

966
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:56,000
Hold on. Am I a kid or what?

967
00:58:56,084 --> 00:58:57,669
You said you didn't see it.

968
00:59:01,464 --> 00:59:03,383
-What's missing?
-Your credit report.

969
00:59:03,466 --> 00:59:05,468
Why tell me now?

970
00:59:05,551 --> 00:59:08,012
You never mentioned it
when I asked you over the phone.

971
00:59:08,096 --> 00:59:09,097
You didn't tell me.

972
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,684
You spoke to someone else,
and I'm sure that person told you.

973
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:15,812
It's the most important document.
The top requirement.

974
00:59:16,938 --> 00:59:18,272
Are you saying I'm lying?

975
00:59:18,356 --> 00:59:20,733
Honestly,
this didn't have to take this long.

976
00:59:20,817 --> 00:59:24,404
And what? "Top"? Why use English?

977
00:59:24,904 --> 00:59:26,698
Right, I didn't have to do that.

978
00:59:26,781 --> 00:59:29,367
But if you brought
all the required documents--

979
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:30,994
-So it's my fault?
-I'm sorry, sir.

980
00:59:31,077 --> 00:59:32,996
I apologize for the inconvenience.

981
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:35,790
There must've been some confusion.

982
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:36,708
I'm really sorry.

983
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:39,669
MANAGER PARK SU-YEON

984
00:59:43,923 --> 00:59:45,591
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT!
CS BANK

985
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,180
Are you a client or an employee here?

986
00:59:51,264 --> 00:59:52,223
An employee, ma'am.

987
00:59:52,724 --> 00:59:55,059
So you know your place,
but you're slow-witted.

988
00:59:55,643 --> 00:59:57,645
You've been with us
for three months already.

989
00:59:57,729 --> 01:00:00,231
Can't you be flexible
when dealing with clients?

990
01:00:00,314 --> 01:00:03,526
I believe we must go by the book
in situations like that.

991
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:07,113
I knew you'd be like this.
You always have something to say.

992
01:00:07,947 --> 01:00:09,866
Why was he assigned to my team?

993
01:00:10,658 --> 01:00:11,826
Ma'am, I'm right here.

994
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,619
I know. I'm talking to myself.

995
01:00:15,288 --> 01:00:16,456
How did you hear that?

996
01:00:16,539 --> 01:00:19,208
It was quite insulting
for something you'd say to someone,

997
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:22,003
so you wanted me to think
that you were talking to yourself.

998
01:00:22,587 --> 01:00:24,130
Oh, I know.

999
01:00:24,213 --> 01:00:26,632
-You're a ballbuster.
-No, I'm not.

1000
01:00:26,716 --> 01:00:29,093
I was a drill instructor
when I was in the military.

1001
01:00:29,177 --> 01:00:31,846
My nickname was Trooper
because I kept on going--

1002
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:33,723
-Okay, I heard you.
-Don't get me wrong.

1003
01:00:33,806 --> 01:00:35,391
I never used violence--

1004
01:00:35,475 --> 01:00:37,101
-Trooper.
-Yes?

1005
01:00:37,769 --> 01:00:40,563
Get back to work. Don't make me
have a word with you again.

1006
01:00:41,606 --> 01:00:43,274
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

1007
01:00:53,785 --> 01:00:54,660
What do you think?

1008
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:58,414
I like it.

1009
01:00:59,248 --> 01:01:02,210
By the way, did something bad happen?

1010
01:01:02,293 --> 01:01:04,003
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

1011
01:01:04,796 --> 01:01:07,590
Really? I'm not good
at hiding my emotions.

1012
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:12,345
I'm too honest and straightforward
that people walk all over me all the time.

1013
01:01:21,312 --> 01:01:23,272
-Is she gone?
-Yes.

1014
01:01:24,649 --> 01:01:25,775
Hold on.

1015
01:01:26,526 --> 01:01:27,902
I almost couldn't breathe.

1016
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:30,488
Why would anyone walk all over her
if she was like that?

1017
01:01:30,571 --> 01:01:32,949
Anyone who goes on about being the victim

1018
01:01:33,032 --> 01:01:34,450
is rarely the victim.

1019
01:01:34,534 --> 01:01:35,910
Do you want another beverage?

1020
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:38,788
No, thank you. Where's the washroom?

1021
01:01:39,497 --> 01:01:41,165
Make a right turn outside the door.

1022
01:01:44,293 --> 01:01:46,462
Please take good care of Hye-jun.

1023
01:01:51,467 --> 01:01:53,010
Did Jin-ju give you an earful?

1024
01:01:53,094 --> 01:01:54,720
It was my fault, you know.

1025
01:01:54,804 --> 01:01:56,722
It was wrong
to ignore her calls like that.

1026
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,769
I like people who reflect on themselves.

1027
01:02:03,396 --> 01:02:04,730
Anything I can do to help?

1028
01:02:05,314 --> 01:02:06,983
Stay out of it. This is my fight.

1029
01:02:11,487 --> 01:02:12,363
Bye.

1030
01:02:17,493 --> 01:02:19,912
Can Jeong-ha travel
for appointments elsewhere?

1031
01:02:24,417 --> 01:02:25,501
Do you like it?

1032
01:02:26,169 --> 01:02:29,172
I should be asking you that question.
Do you like it?

1033
01:02:29,255 --> 01:02:30,923
I always like what you do.

1034
01:02:31,674 --> 01:02:34,677
Why are you so generous today?
Do you pity me?

1035
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:40,349
Don't drink with anyone else from now on.

1036
01:02:40,433 --> 01:02:41,809
-Why?
-Because you're so cute.

1037
01:02:42,602 --> 01:02:44,562
I've heard that too many times.

1038
01:02:44,645 --> 01:02:46,731
-Jeong-ha.
-Fine, I don't hear it often.

1039
01:02:47,315 --> 01:02:49,025
I've heard "pretty" a lot more often.

1040
01:02:49,108 --> 01:02:50,443
-Happy now?
-Yes.

1041
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:53,654
What?

1042
01:02:53,738 --> 01:02:56,365
I said I'd see you at the read-through.
Missed me already?

1043
01:02:56,449 --> 01:02:58,534
Is this where you had to go with Min-jae?

1044
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:00,912
I'm like Min-jae's avatar at the moment.

1045
01:03:00,995 --> 01:03:02,955
I have to do as I'm told.

1046
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:04,498
Please have a seat here, sir.

1047
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:08,753
I'm starting a new movie,
and I want you to be my makeup artist.

1048
01:03:09,754 --> 01:03:12,340
-But I've never done that.
-The salon's okay with it.

1049
01:03:12,423 --> 01:03:15,343
That's great.
I'm in that movie too. I may run into you.

1050
01:03:15,426 --> 01:03:17,637
If I run into you,
I'll do your makeup too.

1051
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,680
That's not cool. You'll be there for him.

1052
01:03:21,807 --> 01:03:24,602
Hey, I'm not hiring her just for myself.

1053
01:03:25,686 --> 01:03:26,771
Gosh, you.

1054
01:03:29,065 --> 01:03:31,943
By the way, where's my manager?

1055
01:03:37,448 --> 01:03:39,325
-He's already here.
-Yes, I see that.

1056
01:03:40,785 --> 01:03:44,121
-You should've booked a room.
-All the rooms were booked. I'm sorry.

1057
01:03:44,705 --> 01:03:46,415
-Next time, book a room.
-Will do.

1058
01:03:52,213 --> 01:03:55,800
Hello! I'm not late. You're early.

1059
01:03:55,883 --> 01:03:58,386
I have another appointment,
so I left the office early.

1060
01:03:58,469 --> 01:04:00,513
My gosh, I guess you're busy.

1061
01:04:03,474 --> 01:04:05,518
Thank you for making the time
to meet with me.

1062
01:04:05,601 --> 01:04:08,813
Hae-hyo got a role
in Director Choi Se-hun's new movie,

1063
01:04:08,896 --> 01:04:11,315
so I wanted to have lunch
with my favorite reporters.

1064
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:13,776
I'm not late, right?

1065
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:15,278
No, Reporter Kim.

1066
01:04:15,361 --> 01:04:17,613
-Reporter Yoon got here first.
-I see.

1067
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:21,117
Let's eat something delicious.

1068
01:04:21,617 --> 01:04:23,577
What about expensive small dishes?

1069
01:04:23,661 --> 01:04:24,620
This is on me.

1070
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:29,333
I'll do it.

1071
01:04:33,212 --> 01:04:35,256
I've never hated anyone this much
in a while.

1072
01:04:36,882 --> 01:04:38,634
Things keep getting tangled.

1073
01:04:38,718 --> 01:04:40,469
I don't know what to do.

1074
01:04:40,553 --> 01:04:42,013
When something gets tangled,

1075
01:04:42,096 --> 01:04:44,640
cutting it off is easier
than untangling it.

1076
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:52,356
If one of us has to stay,

1077
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,191
it'll be me, of course.

1078
01:05:08,706 --> 01:05:10,833
-We'll get this and a bowl of rice.
-Sure.

1079
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:12,460
-Anything to drink?
-No.

1080
01:05:12,543 --> 01:05:14,045
-Got it.
-Thank you.

1081
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,673
<i>There's a class theory
that's popular among my generation.</i>

1082
01:05:18,215 --> 01:05:21,469
<i>Depending on how much financial support
you can get from your parents,</i>

1083
01:05:22,136 --> 01:05:24,638
<i>you're categorized as either
a gold or dirt spoon.</i>

1084
01:05:24,722 --> 01:05:25,806
This is for table 13.

1085
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:28,184
<i>And according to that standard,
I'm a dirt spoon. </i>

1086
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:30,227
Here's the food you ordered.

1087
01:05:31,562 --> 01:05:34,940
<i>I've always loathed that theory.</i>

1088
01:05:38,569 --> 01:05:40,196
So? Have you thought about it?

1089
01:05:41,322 --> 01:05:42,740
I have a read-through tomorrow.

1090
01:05:43,449 --> 01:05:44,617
Oh, gosh.

1091
01:05:45,826 --> 01:05:46,827
So it's a no?

1092
01:05:48,037 --> 01:05:50,873
But I want to keep working here
for as long as I can.

1093
01:05:51,374 --> 01:05:54,001
Be stubborn.
That is the privilege of youth, after all.

1094
01:06:03,552 --> 01:06:05,805
<i>The theory is all about money.</i>

1095
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,558
<i>The emotional stability
I inherited from my parents.</i>

1096
01:06:10,142 --> 01:06:13,521
<i>Honesty and sincerity.
It completely overlooks such values</i>

1097
01:06:15,147 --> 01:06:17,817
<i>as well as my motivation for success,
which I cultivated</i>

1098
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,527
<i>while watching my parents struggle.</i>

1099
01:06:38,337 --> 01:06:39,713
What's Park Do-ha doing here?

1100
01:06:39,797 --> 01:06:41,632
He got the lead role. You didn't know?

1101
01:06:42,591 --> 01:06:45,052
No. I was busy trying
to analyze my character.

1102
01:06:45,136 --> 01:06:47,221
Why did he come with Mr. Lee though?

1103
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:49,306
He is signed with A June Entertainment.

1104
01:06:51,183 --> 01:06:53,727
My gosh, you two. What brings you here?

1105
01:06:54,603 --> 01:06:56,105
We're here for the read-through.

1106
01:06:58,149 --> 01:06:59,233
After you.

1107
01:07:01,402 --> 01:07:02,278
What the hell?

1108
01:07:03,404 --> 01:07:05,448
-After you.
-Let's take the next one.

1109
01:07:06,073 --> 01:07:07,199
Good call.

1110
01:07:09,326 --> 01:07:10,286
Stop them.

1111
01:07:18,586 --> 01:07:19,962
<i>Going up.</i>

1112
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:28,262
When you left, you probably thought
you'd have an easy road ahead.

1113
01:07:31,682 --> 01:07:34,518
Things are going great for him.
That's why he got the role.

1114
01:07:34,602 --> 01:07:35,644
Had he stayed with you,

1115
01:07:35,728 --> 01:07:38,355
he wouldn't even have gotten paid.
It would've been awful.

1116
01:07:38,439 --> 01:07:40,149
Min-jae, why are you butting in?

1117
01:07:40,232 --> 01:07:42,067
Hye-jun, are you mute?

1118
01:07:42,151 --> 01:07:44,653
I'm his manager,
so consider me his spokesperson.

1119
01:07:44,737 --> 01:07:45,571
Manager…

1120
01:07:46,447 --> 01:07:47,656
You're his manager?

1121
01:07:48,157 --> 01:07:51,035
-Quiet down, please.
-Sure thing, Do-ha.

1122
01:07:56,582 --> 01:07:59,877
I have to say,
you'd probably never get married.

1123
01:08:00,461 --> 01:08:03,130
How random.
Are we at a matchmaking agency?

1124
01:08:03,214 --> 01:08:04,798
Do you think Hye-jun will make it?

1125
01:08:04,882 --> 01:08:08,302
His career never took off
even though he was with me for years.

1126
01:08:08,385 --> 01:08:09,470
Mind your own business.

1127
01:08:10,596 --> 01:08:12,556
Don't tell me you have high hopes for him.

1128
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,518
Wake up.
He doesn't even have a fan community.

1129
01:08:15,601 --> 01:08:18,145
Fandom means power,
which translates into popularity.

1130
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:21,774
Fan community? What about it?
It's not like the others always had it.

1131
01:08:21,857 --> 01:08:23,734
You sound so proud.

1132
01:08:23,817 --> 01:08:25,861
You know, it doesn't mean much these days.

1133
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:28,239
You got a role in this movie?

1134
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,366
You got the lead role?

1135
01:08:31,158 --> 01:08:33,786
I've been staying away
from the Internet, so I didn't know.

1136
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,164
You probably got a no-name role anyway,

1137
01:08:37,248 --> 01:08:38,958
so we won't run into each other.

1138
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:42,378
You'll be surprised
when you found out which role I got.

1139
01:08:43,337 --> 01:08:45,005
I flinched when I saw you,

1140
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,134
but thinking about my role makes me happy.

1141
01:08:50,177 --> 01:08:51,804
Which character are you playing?

1142
01:08:52,513 --> 01:08:53,806
Hey, which character?

1143
01:09:25,254 --> 01:09:26,839
Hello.

1144
01:09:26,922 --> 01:09:28,215
-Sir!
-Sir!

1145
01:10:08,422 --> 01:10:09,757
It was you?

1146
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,425
You son of a bitch!

1147
01:10:15,596 --> 01:10:16,847
Son of a bitch?

1148
01:10:41,997 --> 01:10:43,207
I'm not a thug.

1149
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:46,502
Why would I hit you with a stick?

1150
01:10:50,464 --> 01:10:52,383
Hey, that's not your line.

1151
01:10:54,093 --> 01:10:56,387
I'm sorry.
I don't know where that came from.

1152
01:11:00,182 --> 01:11:02,685
Jeez, it's so frustrating
to work with a total rookie.

1153
01:11:05,854 --> 01:11:07,523
-Hye-jun.
-Yes?

1154
01:11:09,441 --> 01:11:10,693
I actually like that.

1155
01:11:10,776 --> 01:11:14,279
Director, then the focus will be on him.

1156
01:11:14,363 --> 01:11:15,531
I'm the lead.

1157
01:11:15,614 --> 01:11:18,033
It'll only help your character shine more.

1158
01:11:18,117 --> 01:11:19,576
What were you going to do next?

1159
01:11:21,912 --> 01:11:23,872
Untying him
and punching the crap out of him

1160
01:11:23,956 --> 01:11:25,958
would make my character
look more ruthless.

1161
01:11:28,293 --> 01:11:29,586
You think so?

1162
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,505
Let's try it. Can you guys untie him?

1163
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:32,881
-Untie him.
-Okay.

1164
01:11:33,799 --> 01:11:34,925
Ouch, that hurts.

1165
01:11:35,008 --> 01:11:38,220
<i>Becoming like him has been my dream
up until now.</i>

1166
01:11:39,722 --> 01:11:41,432
Can you try punching him once?

1167
01:11:42,474 --> 01:11:43,642
-Punch him?
-Give it a go.

1168
01:11:43,726 --> 01:11:44,977
<i>We met again,</i>

1169
01:11:45,894 --> 01:11:47,813
<i>and I've changed.</i>

1170
01:11:55,154 --> 01:11:59,366
<i>Today, I finally realized
why I was so eager to become an actor.</i>

1171
01:12:00,576 --> 01:12:04,705
<i>To an actor, a spoon is just a utensil.</i>

<i>I was so excited today.</i>

1175
01:12:51,919 --> 01:12:54,797
<i>So excited that I couldn't even think
about anything.</i>

1176
01:12:55,756 --> 01:12:57,341
Have you seen my watch?

1177
01:12:57,424 --> 01:12:59,593
You're the only one who would touch it.

1178
01:13:00,093 --> 01:13:02,679
-You're talking nonsense.
-But there's a reasonable doubt.

1179
01:13:02,763 --> 01:13:03,597
<i>Jjajang</i> or <i>jjamppong</i>?

1180
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,515
-<i>Jjajang.</i>
-Jinx.

1181
01:13:04,598 --> 01:13:05,849
Are you two dating?

1182
01:13:05,933 --> 01:13:06,892
-Min-jae!
-Min-jae!

1183
01:13:06,975 --> 01:13:10,646
<i>It's weird.
Every time I'm with you, it rains.</i>

1184
01:13:10,729 --> 01:13:14,316
<i>I just kept thinking
about my character, Su-yeong.</i>

1185
01:13:15,776 --> 01:13:17,277
He's like a different person.
