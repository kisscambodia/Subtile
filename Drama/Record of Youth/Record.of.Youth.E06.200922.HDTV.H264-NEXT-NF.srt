RECORD OF YOUTH

00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,358
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS AN
"EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT" AND IS SUPPORTED

3
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:09,045
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, TOURISM
AND THE KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

4
00:00:10,238 --> 00:00:11,698
There's something I want to say,

5
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:14,450
but I don't know if I should say it.

6
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:15,618
Well…

7
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:18,496
When you're not sure, just don't say it.

8
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:19,831
I'll say it.

9
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,836
-To me?
-I think I like…

10
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:27,880
What?

11
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:32,593
I think I like you.

12
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:53,322
I knew this would happen.

13
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:54,240
Wait.

14
00:01:34,363 --> 00:01:36,699
I have an umbrella at my place.

EPISODE 6

17
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:23,454
-All done?
-Yes.

18
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:27,416
I feel like I can totally count on you
when you fix these things.

19
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,126
So only when I'm good to you?

20
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,296
No, you can't really say that.
This is for the house.

21
00:02:38,427 --> 00:02:43,140
Father hasn't even stepped out of the room
since his early dinner.

22
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:44,517
Maybe he went out.

23
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,644
Where would he go at this late hour?

24
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:54,819
Gosh. Oh, boy.

25
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:02,493
Why am I so tired?

26
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:06,956
Is it because I used the muscles
that I hadn't used for so long?

27
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:11,627
What time is it now?

28
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,629
Oh, boy.

29
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:15,131
Goodness.

30
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,595
Gosh, you startled me!

31
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:23,723
-You're here.
-Of course I'm here. Where would I go?

32
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:26,017
Did you go clubbing?

33
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:27,810
No.

34
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:30,521
Come on. I can see that you danced.

35
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:33,482
Honestly, you really don't know me at all.

36
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:34,859
Where are you going?

37
00:03:34,942 --> 00:03:36,485
To get water. Want to tag along?

38
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:38,821
Dad, let me say this again.

39
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:41,407
I'll cut all ties with you
if you cause trouble again.

40
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,785
Trust me just this once.
I won't let you down.

41
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:46,537
So there's something. Am I right?

42
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:47,455
No!

43
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:49,165
There is. I'm sure of it.

44
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:56,881
Are you done?

45
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:01,969
Why are you so startled?

46
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:05,014
Well… Usually, the person who knocks

47
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:06,557
opens the door, you know.

48
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:08,809
But you opened it first.

49
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:11,604
I wasn't expecting it, so I was startled.

50
00:04:11,687 --> 00:04:13,356
What an earnest answer.

51
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:17,485
-I don't like that.
-Then get out of my house.

52
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:19,153
Okay.

53
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:53,354
That's all you?

54
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:56,023
Yes, my dad drew them for me.

55
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:58,776
Is he an artist?

56
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:02,446
No, he teaches drawing classes
for beginners in Daejeon.

57
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,324
He also gives lectures
at cultural centers.

58
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:06,867
Can I see them?

59
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,202
Sure.

60
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:19,296
How old were you?

61
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,424
Just after my first birthday.

62
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:29,223
Here, I sense a certain vibe.

63
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,851
My mom got remarried around that time.

64
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:35,062
Do you know what's hard
when your parents get a divorce?

65
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:38,899
I'm not telling you.

66
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:42,445
Why ask if you weren't going to tell me?

67
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:46,741
I can't tell you so easily.
Besides, we're not that close yet.

68
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:52,747
All right. I should get going.

69
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,084
Are you upset?

70
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:01,088
No, why would I be?
We're not that close, you know.

71
00:06:01,172 --> 00:06:02,840
-You are upset.
-No, I'm not.

72
00:06:02,923 --> 00:06:05,384
-You are.
-Yes, I am upset.

73
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:09,638
It'd be overwhelming
to be bombarded with information.

74
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:11,640
I'll tell you everything,
little by little.

75
00:06:13,768 --> 00:06:15,936
Can I take that as your answer
to my confession?

76
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:21,108
-"Confession"?
-I confessed my feelings to you earlier.

77
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:25,404
Hold on.

78
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:27,656
Just a moment.

79
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:37,666
"Confession"? I thought
I'd only hear that word in song lyrics.

80
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:41,003
Calm down.

81
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:43,464
Life isn't a song.
I'm happy with how things are now.

82
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:45,758
A new relationship
wouldn't be a good idea.

83
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:49,387
An Jeong-ha, you must resist this.

84
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:04,652
It's stopped raining.

85
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:07,113
Then I don't need to lend you my umbrella.

86
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:14,662
-Hi, Grandpa.
-<i>Hey, why aren't you home yet?</i>

87
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:16,705
I'm heading home now. What's up?

88
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:21,127
<i>Hey, my teacher complimented me today.</i>

89
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,169
Good job.

90
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:25,381
But I have to submit a photo.
They'll send it to an ad agency.

91
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:30,136
<i>What was it called?
Something that starts with "pro" or "pri."</i>

92
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,680
<i>Gosh, what was it? I wrote it down.</i>

93
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:34,765
-Portfolio?
-Yes, that's it!

94
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:37,893
Port… Gosh, why is it so hard?

95
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:39,562
<i>Anyway, that's what I need.</i>

96
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:41,397
Don't worry. I got it.

97
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,107
Just follow my instructions.

98
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,278
Okay. I've given you the latest update,
so I'm off to bed now.

99
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:48,612
All right, good night.

100
00:07:52,116 --> 00:07:53,909
-I should get going.
-Okay.

101
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,377
What are you doing?

102
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:05,754
-Oh, I'll walk you out.
-Why?

103
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:08,591
I'll be left alone
if you just shut the door and leave.

104
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:10,342
But coming home alone is okay?

105
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:12,470
Yes, that's fine because I'm used to it.

106
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:14,263
No, I can't let you.

107
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:16,474
-Why not?
-Then why did I walk you home?

108
00:08:16,557 --> 00:08:17,558
Why did you?

109
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:19,477
To make sure you get home safe.

110
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,531
<i>I need to end that conversation.</i>

111
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:35,409
<i>I must firmly say no to him.</i>

112
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,831
Then what's going to happen to us now?

113
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,127
I mean, we didn't finish
that conversation earlier.

114
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:48,923
You said we should take it slow.

115
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:51,383
Wasn't it your way of saying no?

116
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:55,346
No, I like you too.

117
00:08:57,556 --> 00:09:00,309
Then what's after that "I like you too"?

118
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:05,105
I'm not sure. You tell me.

119
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:07,608
Dating.

120
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:19,203
<i>I lost.</i>

121
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,135
I'll do your grandpa's makeup
when he's taking photos for his portfolio.

122
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:37,137
Am I being too nosy?

123
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:39,473
No, I'd be grateful.

124
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:40,891
Then I'll do it.

125
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:44,395
Now that I'm no longer your fan,
I need someone else to obsess over.

126
00:09:44,478 --> 00:09:46,397
A fan's greatest joy
is to watch them grow.

127
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:48,190
Do it if you want to.

128
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,985
Thanks.

129
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:15,134
<i>I wonder if Jeong-ha stood there
until she could no longer see me.</i>

130
00:10:16,302 --> 00:10:19,972
<i>I wanted to turn around, but didn't.</i>

131
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:23,559
<i>I should have, to lock eyes with her.</i>

132
00:10:38,365 --> 00:10:40,701
MIN-JAE

133
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:44,038
<i>I heard you got hurt.</i>

134
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:45,789
<i>I'm at the cafe near your place.</i>

135
00:10:57,968 --> 00:11:01,722
<i>I should've held on to our beginning
for a little longer.</i>

136
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:07,061
<i>At the time,
I didn't know we'd end up like this.</i>

137
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:28,248
Hey, what is that?

138
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:30,709
Do you know how worried I've been?

139
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:32,461
Why didn't you tell me?

140
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:34,213
Have you seen a doctor yet?

141
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:37,883
You have too many questions.
My answer is, it's all good now.

142
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:39,551
Why did you come all the way here?

143
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:44,515
To see how bad the wound is
and tell you the good news in person.

144
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:45,891
I got the role?

145
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:48,310
Yes, you did. Isn't it amazing?

146
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:49,895
Things are happening for us.

147
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:52,314
It's a bit scary
because everything's going so well.

148
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:54,274
It's because you're a great manager.

149
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:55,651
By the way, where were you?

150
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:59,279
I have something to tell you.
I haven't told anyone yet.

151
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:12,126
WON HAE-HYO

152
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,378
<i>Is it too late? I just wanted to check in.</i>

153
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:16,463
<i>Don't tell me you're still on the set.</i>

154
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:28,100
<i>I'm at home. Good night.</i>

155
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:30,352
That's like, "Don't talk to me."

156
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,022
<i>All right, good night.</i>

157
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:43,657
Excuse me. Coming through.

158
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,200
-Take care of this for me.
-Sure.

159
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:47,411
-Thank you. Have a good day.
-Have a good day.

160
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:53,500
-Hello.
-Hello.

161
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:57,254
My gosh, look who's here.

162
00:12:57,337 --> 00:12:59,715
You've gotten even more handsome.

163
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:01,091
Do you have yellow tulips?

164
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:03,260
Who is it for? Your girlfriend?

165
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:10,350
They're so beautiful.

166
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:12,853
The omelet is a little different today.

167
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:14,938
I put in some tofu and tuna.

168
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:18,400
I love it when you do this
whenever your dad is away for work.

169
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:19,485
I can rely on you.

170
00:13:19,568 --> 00:13:21,361
This is the joy of having a son.

171
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,659
Mom, only his future wife
will benefit from all this.

172
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:29,119
This is good for all of us.

173
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:31,872
And he was good to me
even when he was dating his ex.

174
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:33,373
Well, you were fond of her too.

175
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:35,918
He might marry a girl you don't like.

176
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:37,544
That will not happen.

177
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:41,215
I'm worried about you.
Your taste is inconsistent.

178
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:44,301
-Hae-hyo, what about the syrup?
-Get it yourself.

179
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:47,304
You already did all this work.
Don't you want it to be perfect?

180
00:13:48,222 --> 00:13:49,389
No, I don't.

181
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:50,599
That didn't work.

182
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:55,020
My dear brother, I want the syrup.

183
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:56,396
Get me the syrup!

184
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,690
Hey, don't do that. Jeez.

185
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,652
Hey, that was weird.

186
00:14:02,152 --> 00:14:03,654
Why change the topic?

187
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:05,489
-What?
-Who'd date her?

188
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:07,282
I feel bad for that guy.

189
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:09,034
She's so self-centered.

190
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:10,452
But she's pretty.

191
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:12,162
And she comes from a good family.

192
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:13,956
She's perfect.

193
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,791
Gosh, cut it out.

194
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:20,337
Throw some ricotta cheese in your salad.
That has no protein.

195
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,965
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:26,051
Will you go straight to the shoot
from the hair salon?

197
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:27,511
Mom, you're really--

198
00:14:27,594 --> 00:14:29,888
I'm your loyal, hardworking assistant.

199
00:14:30,472 --> 00:14:32,349
More like a micromanager if you ask me.

200
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:34,309
Agreed.

201
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,354
You'd better behave yourself at the salon.

202
00:14:37,437 --> 00:14:40,065
You have to take your career
to the next level.

203
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:41,733
Don't be the subject of gossip.

204
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,652
But what if I actually date her?

205
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:45,362
Then people will definitely gossip.

206
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:47,072
Son, I'm having a great morning.

207
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:50,117
You made breakfast
to put a smile on my face. Thank you.

208
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,036
I want to stay in this good mood
the whole morning, okay?

209
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,954
Amen.

210
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,385
You seem very excited these days.

211
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:13,307
-Me?
-I know who those flowers are for,

212
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:15,517
but just don't do it.

213
00:15:16,226 --> 00:15:18,395
-Why not?
-Because then you'll have to date her.

214
00:15:18,478 --> 00:15:20,480
You're getting too ahead of yourself.

215
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:22,608
She has to be on board.

216
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:24,693
Who'd reject you?

217
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:26,653
I don't want you to end up hurting her.

218
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:34,411
Congratulations.
You're officially a designer now.

219
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:35,954
Bring in lots of new clients.

220
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:37,539
I'll do my best.

221
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:39,374
And try to get along with Jin-ju.

222
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,834
Yes, I will.

223
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:48,467
I organized the brushes. Did you see?

224
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,594
I took a glance.
I'm sure you did a good job.

225
00:15:50,677 --> 00:15:51,970
Let me see.

226
00:15:52,054 --> 00:15:54,765
"Designer An Jeong-ha." So cool!

227
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:56,600
You two seem excited.

228
00:15:56,683 --> 00:16:00,062
Su-bin, you've been promoted to assistant
because I approved it.

229
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:03,815
I'll do my best. I'll assist both of you
to the best of my ability.

230
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,025
"Both of you"?

231
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:15,786
Did you really clean this brush?

232
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,788
I've even disinfected it.

233
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,296
Did you use conditioner?

234
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:29,299
Sorry. I should've trained her better--

235
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:33,387
Oh, right. She told me to use it,
but I forgot. I'm sorry.

236
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,721
What is this?

237
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:37,474
Are you girls trying
to cover up for each other or what?

238
00:16:37,557 --> 00:16:38,767
This is ridiculous.

239
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,852
-Go wash it again.
-Yup!

240
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:41,770
What?

241
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:44,815
"Yup"? Are you kidding me?

242
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:46,525
This is where you work.

243
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:49,736
Su-bin, you told me the other day

244
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,114
that I'm your favorite
and you'll be loyal to me.

245
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:53,865
Are you betraying me already?

246
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,202
Pardon? No, ma'am.

247
00:16:57,285 --> 00:17:00,872
Right? You'd better keep your word.

248
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:07,379
Jeong-ha, I never said that.

249
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:08,547
I know.

250
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:11,925
I'll go bring another brush.
There's a clean one.

251
00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:20,100
Hey, when did you get here?

252
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,520
Here.

253
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:25,397
What's this for?

254
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,982
I was getting flowers for my mom.

255
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:29,985
It smells so good.

256
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:31,737
-Do you like flowers?
-No.

257
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:34,322
I do, of course.

258
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:36,908
You looked sullen, but you're smiling now.

259
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:38,243
Did you get scolded again?

260
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:41,413
"Again"?
Do you think I get scolded every day?

261
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:45,167
I've officially been promoted to designer.

262
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,044
My gosh, that's awesome.

263
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:50,172
Gosh, talk about perfect timing.

264
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:52,340
I got the flowers to congratulate you.

265
00:17:52,424 --> 00:17:54,301
It's too late to fool me.

266
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:57,554
Want to grab dinner together?
My treat, to congratulate you.

267
00:17:58,305 --> 00:18:00,974
Oh, I have plans this evening.

268
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:02,642
With Hye-jun.

269
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:05,062
What? Is it a date?

270
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:09,066
No, not today. I'm helping his grandfather
with his portfolio.

271
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:11,526
"Not today"? So you two
will go on a date tomorrow?

272
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,819
Maybe?

273
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:16,490
You two… Seriously?

274
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:19,743
I was totally determined not to date him,

275
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:21,203
but I couldn't resist.

276
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:25,040
Am I doing the right thing, Hae-hyo?

277
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:29,544
This is already so interesting.

278
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:33,256
A while back, you said only chaos awaits
when fantasy meets reality.

279
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:35,759
You remember that?

280
00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:36,968
I do.

281
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:39,888
Good for you. You can tease me about it
for a million years.

282
00:18:39,971 --> 00:18:42,516
I just couldn't help it.

283
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,394
You'll date him for a million years?

284
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,688
Gosh, stop teasing me.

285
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:55,779
I wasn't teasing her.

286
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:20,762
JIN-U

287
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:25,183
-Hey.
-Come to the studio with your grandpa.

288
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:26,977
<i>Just let me borrow the camera.</i>

289
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,354
You can't go ahead
and let us use the studio.

290
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:32,858
I got my boss' permission.
Gosh, seriously.

291
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:36,695
You're so difficult
even when someone's offering help.

292
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:39,322
People like you really need help.

293
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:40,490
Thanks.

294
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:43,160
<i>You motivate me
to open my own studio sooner.</i>

295
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:44,327
You've saved up enough?

296
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:46,371
<i>I'm not doing it with my own money.</i>

297
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:49,082
<i>I just need some help
from the bank and my dad.</i>

298
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:55,338
Look at me eating this
even though I had breakfast.

299
00:19:55,422 --> 00:19:57,048
You're such a good cook.

300
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:58,383
Gosh, I'm glad you like it.

301
00:19:58,466 --> 00:19:59,968
-Maybe I'll do it again.
-Good.

302
00:20:00,886 --> 00:20:04,055
This pancake goes really well
with <i>makgeolli</i>.

303
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,558
-You don't have any, right?
-I'd say no even if I did.

304
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:08,018
It's too early for alcohol.

305
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:09,811
Yeong-nam and I have to go to work.

306
00:20:09,895 --> 00:20:11,062
You're so self-centered.

307
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:14,441
A little bit is fine. I never said
we should drink until we drop.

308
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,651
We just never see eye to eye.

309
00:20:16,735 --> 00:20:19,112
Look at Yeong-nam.
He only says nice things.

310
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:20,822
He's not like that with me.

311
00:20:20,906 --> 00:20:24,451
Of course, you wouldn't stay quiet
when someone's complimenting me.

312
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:25,702
I'm just stating a fact.

313
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:28,455
You scold me every single day.

314
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:31,666
Why did you bring that up?
They're fighting because of what you said.

315
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,959
No, we're not fighting.

316
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:35,670
Why stick your nose in and get told off?

317
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:37,088
He didn't get told off.

318
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:40,592
You two are truly a match made in heaven.

319
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:42,469
-No.
-No.

320
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:45,889
Fine, you're not.

321
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:48,934
My gosh, that's so pretty.

322
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:50,769
Oh, this? It's new.

323
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:53,063
It's a knockoff,
but it was still expensive.

324
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:55,607
You can afford to buy authentic stuff.
You're rich.

325
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,360
Gosh, had Father never lost all the money,

326
00:20:58,443 --> 00:21:00,862
you wouldn't have had to sell the house.

327
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:04,574
I tell myself the money was never ours.
That way, I feel better.

328
00:21:08,954 --> 00:21:10,372
Hi.

329
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:12,582
Oh, Hye-jun! It's been a while.

330
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,042
What happened to your face?

331
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,335
I got hurt during a shoot.

332
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:18,463
You even make that band-aid look so cool.

333
00:21:18,964 --> 00:21:20,590
Dad, I need the car in the evening.

334
00:21:20,674 --> 00:21:21,800
Where are you going?

335
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:24,636
Don't ask such a thing.
I'm sure he has stuff to do.

336
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:29,975
Hye-jun,
is Park Do-ha handsome even in real life?

337
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:31,268
Yes.

338
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:33,270
Can you get me his autograph?

339
00:21:33,353 --> 00:21:35,188
I can't ask him because we're not close.

340
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,899
I guess he's arrogant
because he's super famous.

341
00:21:37,983 --> 00:21:40,443
No, it's not that. Anyway, have fun.

342
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:41,361
See you.

343
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:45,615
No, rumor has it that he's very rude.

344
00:21:45,699 --> 00:21:47,993
He and Lee Mun-jeong broke up
because he cheated.

345
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:49,953
With multiple girls, even.

346
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:53,248
You always talk about celebrities.
Do you have nothing better to do?

347
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:55,583
What? It's fun.

348
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:58,586
It's fun to even just look
at those good-looking people.

349
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,755
Talking about them is more fun.

350
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,843
Celebrities would rather be bad-mouthed
than not be talked about at all.

351
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:08,555
No way. Are they perverts?
Who likes to be bad-mouthed?

352
00:22:08,638 --> 00:22:12,142
That's just what people say to lessen
their guilt about bad-mouthing them.

353
00:22:12,225 --> 00:22:15,061
You guys, seriously… I'm upset.

354
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:17,981
Why are you all quiet?
Why aren't you taking my side?

355
00:22:18,064 --> 00:22:20,775
Yeong-nam, we should get going.

356
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:22,485
Shall we?

357
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,371
Where are you going?

358
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:36,124
-I have a shift.
-You still work there?

359
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:39,419
You said you're filming a movie.
Are they not even paying you?

360
00:22:41,296 --> 00:22:43,339
I'll get paid when the filming is done.

361
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:45,592
Must you talk like this to me
right before work?

362
00:22:45,675 --> 00:22:48,261
That thing on your forehead
is making me angry.

363
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:53,016
Where's your grandpa?

364
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:55,560
If you notice anything odd,
tell me right away.

365
00:22:55,643 --> 00:22:57,312
I can't let him cause trouble again.

366
00:22:57,395 --> 00:22:59,397
Can't you let go of his past mistake?

367
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:01,107
People don't change.

368
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:32,222
You don't have a class today.

369
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:35,100
I came to practice.

370
00:23:35,183 --> 00:23:38,686
If you over-practice right off the bat,
you'll get muscle cramps.

371
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,773
This isn't my first time
doing something with my body.

372
00:23:41,856 --> 00:23:44,692
I used to dance, you know.

373
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:47,862
Oh, I knew it. You're flexible.

374
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:49,656
And I see some muscles too.

375
00:23:50,782 --> 00:23:54,077
Also, my grandson

376
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:57,539
paid for my classes.

377
00:23:57,622 --> 00:23:59,958
I should be doing it for him,

378
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,669
but he's taking care of me instead.

379
00:24:02,752 --> 00:24:06,464
Oh, look at you
bragging about your grandson.

380
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,385
He'll even take photos of me today.

381
00:24:19,394 --> 00:24:20,562
Hi, friend.

382
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,732
-I'm a customer today.
-Do you have a shoot?

383
00:24:24,816 --> 00:24:26,317
No, a pre-shoot meeting.

384
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:28,278
-How many and what kind?
-I'll need ten.

385
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:30,697
And for the menu… Let me see.

386
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:32,657
I'll leave it up to you.

387
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,535
I like meat,
so I'll pick the ones with meat.

388
00:24:36,244 --> 00:24:38,037
And one club sandwich for me.

389
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:45,086
Hey, are you all right?

390
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:47,338
Park Do-ha's name is trending.

391
00:24:47,422 --> 00:24:49,090
That happens often enough.

392
00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:50,383
A new music video?

393
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:55,346
"Park Do-ha, Americano."
"Park Do-ha, assault."

394
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,015
His name is everywhere.

395
00:24:57,098 --> 00:24:59,893
This won't affect the movie
you guys are filming, will it?

396
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:01,477
I'm not sure.

397
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:03,146
You should ask Min-jae.

398
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:06,357
If bad stuff happens to him now,
it can't be good for the movie.

399
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:10,445
MIN-JAE

400
00:25:10,528 --> 00:25:11,863
<i>Another hardworking day.</i>

401
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:13,740
<i>It's scary, things are going too well.</i>

402
00:25:13,823 --> 00:25:15,158
<i>Anyway, we got this!</i>

403
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:18,244
Speak of the devil, and she shall appear.

404
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:20,872
She's such an amazing manager.

405
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:24,042
I even got a role in a mini-series.

406
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:27,670
Hye-jun, you're finally--

407
00:25:27,754 --> 00:25:30,965
I'll pay for the sandwiches so that
you can brag a little to your boss.

408
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:33,801
-Okay. Congratulations.
-Thanks.

409
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:36,471
DIRECTOR YOON JI-HO

410
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:42,227
Why isn't he picking up?

411
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:48,191
-<i>Hello, Min-jae.</i>
-Hello, I'm just calling to say hi.

412
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:50,610
Don't hesitate to contact me
if you need anything.

413
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:53,321
<i>Min-jae, why didn't you tell me?</i>

414
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,240
-Pardon me?
-<i>Sa Hye-jun.</i>

415
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:57,533
<i>I heard he betrayed Tae-su
to sign with you.</i>

416
00:25:57,617 --> 00:25:58,993
No, that's not true!

417
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:02,121
Where are you? Let's talk in person.

418
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:05,124
<i>Forget it. I made a fool of myself.</i>

419
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,210
Who said that?

420
00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:09,087
<i>I heard it from Tae-su.</i>

421
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,505
Wait, Director--

422
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:13,132
Director!

423
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:21,224
Gosh, this bastard!

424
00:26:22,725 --> 00:26:23,935
Darn it.

425
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:27,188
LEE TAE-SU

426
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:31,276
Pick up.

427
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,363
I said pick up.

428
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,324
Pick up!

429
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:39,867
LEE TAE-SU

00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,415
HOURLY TRENDING KEYWORDS

ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS

432
00:26:51,504 --> 00:26:52,839
PARK DO-HA PUSHES A FAN

433
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:57,427
This obnoxious punk. Gosh, seriously…

434
00:27:00,596 --> 00:27:01,723
What the hell?

435
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:05,435
-Don't worry.
-You couldn't tell them not to publish it?

436
00:27:05,518 --> 00:27:09,230
I could've, had you told me. But
this already happened. I can sort it out.

437
00:27:09,314 --> 00:27:10,481
How?

438
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,277
"Attack the messenger
if you can't attack the message."

439
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,237
Besides, the message itself is so wrong.

440
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:19,449
I mean, how was I supposed to know
that she was my fan?

441
00:27:19,532 --> 00:27:20,950
She showed up and grabbed me.

442
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:22,493
I'll take care of it,

443
00:27:24,996 --> 00:27:26,497
so calm down.

444
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:31,044
So what exactly are you going to do
to take care of it?

445
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:33,838
I've only known you
for a little while, right?

446
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:35,173
So how can I trust you?

447
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:37,216
You're just like me.

448
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,802
Of course you wouldn't trust me.
I totally get it.

449
00:27:40,553 --> 00:27:43,222
But wouldn't it be better for you
to stay out of it?

450
00:27:43,306 --> 00:27:45,850
If things go south,
it won't just end with me.

451
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:48,227
It'll affect you as well.

452
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,690
Are you sure you can sort it all out?

453
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:56,527
"The Next Park Do-ha"?
Change the headline.

454
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:58,488
Did you see his name trending today?

455
00:27:58,988 --> 00:28:01,282
I know he has a solid fandom.
And with the K-wave,

456
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:02,700
he won't go down easily.

457
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:05,078
But I don't want Hae-hyo
to be associated with him.

458
00:28:07,914 --> 00:28:10,875
Okay, fine.
We'll use him this time, but no more.

459
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:13,336
Has Hae-hyo left for the ad shoot?

460
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,763
All done?

461
00:28:23,846 --> 00:28:25,264
Yes, I got everything.

462
00:28:25,348 --> 00:28:26,849
-Let's go.
-Okay.

463
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:32,063
HYE-JUN

464
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:33,147
<i>Is work going well!</i>

465
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:37,527
Stop smiling, will you?

466
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,445
Can I make a quick phone call?

467
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:41,364
Hey, it's a text. Just text back.

468
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:43,950
-If you call, he'll be flustered.
-That's what I want.

469
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:55,044
<i>I'm having a good day at work.
I'll see you at eight.</i>

470
00:28:55,128 --> 00:28:56,713
Why aren't you calling him?

471
00:28:56,796 --> 00:29:00,466
He asked me if work was going well,
but he put an exclamation mark at the end.

472
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,677
Most people would put
a question mark, right?

473
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,262
What do you think this means?

474
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:07,557
He's convinced that
I must be doing a great job at work.

475
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:11,394
Why ask me if you were going
to answer the question yourself?

476
00:29:11,477 --> 00:29:12,854
Oh, sorry.

477
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:18,025
You like him that much?

478
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:20,236
Yes, I do.

479
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,487
Let's go.

480
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:24,782
Come on.

481
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:25,992
I'm coming.

482
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:38,296
YEONGNAM REPAIR AND BUILDING

483
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:48,598
All right.

484
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:51,642
-Fasten your seat belt.
-Fastened.

485
00:29:53,436 --> 00:29:54,437
Let's go!

486
00:29:55,521 --> 00:29:57,064
Let's go!

487
00:30:20,912 --> 00:30:22,288
My blood sugar's bottomed out.

488
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:29,629
So good.

489
00:30:36,886 --> 00:30:37,971
Cut.

490
00:30:46,938 --> 00:30:49,899
Can you get more of it on your lips
when you're eating it?

491
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:50,942
Sure.

492
00:30:51,025 --> 00:30:52,944
Have you had too much of it?

493
00:30:53,027 --> 00:30:54,904
No, it's fine. It's delicious.

494
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:56,531
I like that attitude. Okay.

495
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:58,366
Let's fix your makeup.

496
00:30:58,449 --> 00:30:59,701
The makeup team!

497
00:30:59,784 --> 00:31:00,910
Yes!

498
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:11,754
-You must be hot.
-Yes.

499
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:23,766
Thanks.

500
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:49,709
I guess your friend isn't coming.

501
00:31:50,835 --> 00:31:52,503
She always keeps her promises.

502
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:55,923
JEONG-HA

503
00:31:58,676 --> 00:31:59,719
Hey, Jeong-ha.

504
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:02,013
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

505
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:03,306
Tell him I said sorry.

506
00:32:04,307 --> 00:32:07,518
It's okay. Don't come if you're busy.
Don't stress yourself out.

507
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:10,271
No, I'm done.
I can be there in 20 minutes.

508
00:32:10,354 --> 00:32:11,355
Okay.

509
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:17,320
I'll give you a ride.

510
00:32:32,126 --> 00:32:33,086
We're here.

511
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:34,670
Thank you.

512
00:32:35,338 --> 00:32:36,380
Bye.

513
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:51,979
<i>Back then, I chose friendship
over love without question.</i>

514
00:32:54,148 --> 00:32:56,109
<i>But now,
I want to make a different choice.</i>

515
00:32:56,818 --> 00:32:59,028
<i>I've still got a chance.</i>

516
00:33:11,374 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm so sorry that I'm late, sir.

517
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:25,721
That looks great.

518
00:33:27,348 --> 00:33:29,267
Hye-jun, you're in the frame. Move back.

519
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,726
-Sorry. Better?
-Great.

520
00:33:33,521 --> 00:33:34,480
My gosh.

521
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:36,440
-This one, we'll just…
-Wow.

522
00:33:36,524 --> 00:33:38,317
-No.
-My gosh.

523
00:33:38,401 --> 00:33:40,736
-You're in the frame again.
-What about this?

524
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,071
-Nice.
-Amazing.

525
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:43,990
Great. That's nice.

526
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:46,117
That's good, but take a step back.

527
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,244
Really? Okay. Let's do this.

528
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:50,997
Hye-jun, hold it,
so the light gets reflected.

529
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,585
-Hye-jun.
-Sorry.

530
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:56,794
-It's too long.
-Hye-jun.

531
00:33:56,878 --> 00:33:57,795
Like this.

532
00:34:00,882 --> 00:34:01,883
Hye-jun, fix his clothes.

533
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:03,801
There you go.

534
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:05,511
-No.
-Looking good.

535
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:09,056
-Grandpa.
-Is it long?

536
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,266
That's too long.

537
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,726
-Yes.
-Make it short.

538
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:13,895
-Jeong-ha, fix his clothes.
-Okay.

539
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:22,612
It'd be nice if we all could drink.
But you guys have to drive. What a shame.

540
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:24,822
Let's drink next time.
There's always tomorrow.

541
00:34:24,906 --> 00:34:27,825
No. When you're my age,
it wouldn't be weird

542
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,785
if I were to die tomorrow.

543
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:40,504
Grandpa, you just killed the mood.

544
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:42,965
You should sing.

545
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:45,843
Hey. You can't ask your elder to sing.

546
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:48,054
Wait. Why not? Sing, please.

547
00:34:48,137 --> 00:34:49,305
That's enough.

548
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:51,474
Why would he sing here?

549
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:56,729
Come on, man. I was just joking.
Why are you so serious?

550
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,023
We're here to have fun,
not to get serious.

551
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:00,942
I was joking, too.

552
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:02,652
-Really?
-Come on.

553
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:04,111
-Seriously?
-Sorry.

554
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:05,738
Okay.

555
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:08,032
-Sorry.
-Gosh.

556
00:35:08,783 --> 00:35:12,828
You guys are so beautiful.

557
00:35:14,205 --> 00:35:15,748
Sir, let's raise our glasses.

558
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:17,208
You'll make a toast, right?

559
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:19,710
Before I do that,

560
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:23,256
I would like to thank you guys first.

561
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:27,593
Today,

562
00:35:29,971 --> 00:35:33,057
I learned a lot from you guys.

563
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:36,143
When I was 20,

564
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:40,398
I wasn't as smart as you.

565
00:35:41,274 --> 00:35:43,526
But I gave birth to my son.

566
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:46,904
That's the best thing I've done in my life

567
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:50,449
because my son gave me Hye-jun.

568
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:53,869
After meeting Hye-jun,

569
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:55,246
I met Jin-u

570
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,499
and Jeong-ha.

571
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:02,211
That's why I feel elated today.

572
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:06,340
And I am very envious of you.

573
00:36:06,424 --> 00:36:07,300
And…

574
00:36:14,557 --> 00:36:16,934
thank you for adoring me.

575
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:20,187
Thank you so much for that, too.

576
00:36:21,147 --> 00:36:22,982
All right. Cheers.

577
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:26,152
Oh, right. There's one more occasion
for us to celebrate.

578
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:29,280
Hye-jun got cast for a mini-series drama.

579
00:36:31,073 --> 00:36:33,326
It's too early to tell.
I haven't met the director yet.

580
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:35,953
Min-jae said you got it.
Then, you have the role.

581
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:38,664
Hey, that's great news.
Here's my toast to my life.

582
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:41,334
Thank you.

583
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:44,628
-Thank you. All right.
-Thank you.

584
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,679
That hits the spot.

585
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:56,515
-Grandpa, have some.
-Okay.

586
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,142
You should have some, Hye-jun.

587
00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:00,686
-You should eat, sir.
-You should eat.

588
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,104
You should eat, Grandpa.

589
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:10,154
You can check every corner.

590
00:37:17,661 --> 00:37:20,664
I've been hiding this listing
for my close friend of mine.

591
00:37:20,748 --> 00:37:22,333
It's 400,000 won a month?

592
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:23,501
<i>It is cheap.</i>

593
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,418
Not bad.

594
00:37:24,502 --> 00:37:26,670
It's better than "not bad." It's great.

595
00:37:26,754 --> 00:37:28,255
So no mortgage on the house?

596
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:31,342
Gosh, you don't trust me.
No one will ever try to con you.

597
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:39,225
Do you have the copy of register
and the POA, right?

598
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:41,852
-Of course. Take a seat.
-Okay.

599
00:37:42,603 --> 00:37:44,188
The POA from the property owner.

600
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:46,148
Here's the authentication of the seal.

601
00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:53,114
I should sign the contract
directly with the property owner.

602
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:55,741
If you don't trust me, don't sign it.

603
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:58,119
-I have people waiting for this listing.
-Gosh.

604
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:01,080
-I didn't say I won't sign.
-Come on.

605
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:02,957
I like smart people, you know.

606
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,501
You work at a bank,
so I put in a good word for you.

607
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,420
All right. Look at this.

608
00:38:07,503 --> 00:38:10,089
Here's today's date
on the copy of the title register.

609
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,927
The title was transferred to the current
owner, Kwon Nam-hui. You see it, right?

610
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:18,264
And you can see that
the owner paid off all the mortgage.

611
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:20,224
So no mortgage on the house.

612
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,560
-Right.
-Will you sign then?

613
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:26,063
Yes.

614
00:38:26,147 --> 00:38:29,108
TOP TEN TRENDING KEYWORDS
PARK DO-HA ASSAULT

615
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:31,652
USED EXCESSIVE FORCE
POSSIBLY ASSAULTED HIS FAN

616
00:38:31,735 --> 00:38:33,404
PARK DO-HA PUSHES OVER A FAN

617
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,365
I FEEL BAD FOR DO-HA

618
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:37,950
THAT STUPID FAN IS TO BLAME

619
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:40,244
DON'T BADMOUTH DO-HA
WHY GRAB HIM WHEN HE SAID NO

620
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:44,123
DON'T ACT LIKE YOU'RE THE VICTIM

621
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,502
DON'T MAKE DO-HA A BAD PERSON

622
00:38:48,586 --> 00:38:51,046
THAT FAN IS A CRAZY BITCH

623
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,926
I WOULD'VE PUNCHED HER IF I WERE HIM
YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE HIS FAN

624
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,304
WHAT ABOUT PARK DO-HA?
HE'S ENDURED MENTAL ABUSE

625
00:38:58,387 --> 00:39:00,764
IT'S SO HARD TO BE A CELEBRITY
HE CAME OUT FOR COFFEE

626
00:39:15,446 --> 00:39:17,239
The articles are all under control now.

627
00:39:17,323 --> 00:39:19,492
My gosh, you're amazing, sir.

628
00:39:19,575 --> 00:39:22,786
Let's send some gifts to the journalists
who wrote

629
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,288
these articles today.

630
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:25,623
Why?

631
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:31,795
Do you know how a traveler takes off his
clothes in a story from <i>Aesop's Fables?</i>

632
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:35,341
If you get hot,

633
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:38,511
you take your clothes off
even when you're told not to.

634
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:39,678
Okay.

635
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:41,263
You didn't get it, did you?

636
00:39:41,347 --> 00:39:43,849
-No.
-That's why you must learn from me.

637
00:39:44,725 --> 00:39:46,769
Then, I'll help you set up
your own agency.

638
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,938
Okay. I'll do my best.

639
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:52,608
Go pick up Do-ha. I'm leaving now.

640
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:53,609
Yes, sir.

641
00:40:03,118 --> 00:40:04,119
Mr. Lee!

642
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:10,167
Hello.

643
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:14,421
-Why won't you answer my calls?
-I've been busy.

644
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:16,006
I had to handle Do-ha's articles.

645
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,591
I thought you'd changed

646
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:22,638
because you're a director
at a big company, making good money now.

647
00:40:23,264 --> 00:40:25,933
It's not like I came to you for a favor.

648
00:40:26,016 --> 00:40:27,810
I see. You met with Mr. Yoon.

649
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:31,313
That's how you found out
that I blew the chance for Hye-jun.

650
00:40:31,397 --> 00:40:32,690
Why did you do it?

651
00:40:32,773 --> 00:40:35,317
You wanted me to teach you as your senior.

652
00:40:35,401 --> 00:40:37,278
That's what I did.

653
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:38,988
What lesson I should learn here?

654
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:42,408
You need to get used to this
if you want to make a rookie popular.

655
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:47,037
In this industry, there's a truckful
of people who backstab you.

656
00:40:48,122 --> 00:40:49,623
I gave you a sneak peek.

657
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:53,460
I know you're grateful.

658
00:40:54,211 --> 00:40:56,297
I'm so grateful that I might cry.

659
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,215
No. You should be crying blood.

660
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:03,804
If there's anything I can do
to get in your way, I will.

661
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:06,599
Why?

662
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:10,102
Because both of you left me.

663
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:15,107
You were the one who caused it.

664
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,692
Oh, right.

665
00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:19,486
Did you tell Hye-jun that he was cast?

666
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,864
You must tell him that he's not anymore.
Too bad.

667
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:24,742
That's what I was going for.
Making you two suffer.

668
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:26,619
Hey! You…

669
00:41:27,703 --> 00:41:28,704
You…

670
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:31,540
Don't call yourself a human being.

671
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:34,877
That's right. Now we're talking.
You're finally learning.

672
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,880
Agents aren't human.
We're a different species.

673
00:41:39,506 --> 00:41:41,800
So we speak a different language.

674
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:23,759
JEONG-HA

675
00:42:28,305 --> 00:42:31,850
<i>We congratulated Hye-jun
on getting cast in the drama</i>

676
00:42:31,934 --> 00:42:34,937
<i>It would have been more fun
if you were here with us.</i>

677
00:43:12,683 --> 00:43:15,144
-It's the same room, right?
-Yes, I set it up there.

678
00:43:19,732 --> 00:43:21,191
Make sure no one sees him.

679
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:22,526
Yes. I'll make sure of it.

680
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:25,404
Let's talk now.

681
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:27,197
What did you do?

682
00:43:27,281 --> 00:43:29,575
There are two ways
in stopping such articles.

683
00:43:29,658 --> 00:43:30,993
One is manipulating comments.

684
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:34,121
The other is publishing other articles.
It's a diversion mechanism.

685
00:43:36,623 --> 00:43:38,959
Now, do you trust me?

686
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:40,836
Well,

687
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:42,921
you're not so bad.

688
00:43:44,715 --> 00:43:47,509
People like us
who don't trust people easily

689
00:43:47,593 --> 00:43:49,303
can only trust numbers in the end.

690
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:52,097
The numbers for likes and dislikes.

691
00:43:52,681 --> 00:43:54,600
If you want people on your side,

692
00:43:54,683 --> 00:43:56,935
you fix the numbers to your advantage.

693
00:43:59,354 --> 00:44:01,774
You're smarter than I thought.

694
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:06,278
I was born in 1977, the year of the snake.

695
00:44:10,282 --> 00:44:11,658
You can call me by my name.

696
00:44:15,162 --> 00:44:16,246
Okay.

697
00:44:16,872 --> 00:44:17,706
Tae-su.

698
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:21,293
We live in such a great world.

699
00:44:21,376 --> 00:44:22,669
Let's live for 1,000 years.

700
00:44:22,753 --> 00:44:24,421
Let's live long!

701
00:44:26,006 --> 00:44:27,549
Did you guys already get started?

702
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:28,759
Don't make me sad now.

703
00:44:28,842 --> 00:44:29,927
-Of course not.
-Sir.

704
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,012
-Not until you get here.
-I missed you.

705
00:44:32,095 --> 00:44:34,181
-Come on in. Hurry inside.
-Have you been well?

706
00:44:34,264 --> 00:44:35,766
-I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

707
00:44:46,902 --> 00:44:47,945
All right.

708
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,824
Thank you. Okay.

709
00:44:52,908 --> 00:44:54,493
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

710
00:44:54,576 --> 00:44:55,911
-Good night.
-Good night.

711
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:04,002
Isn't that Jin-u's car?
Why did he give you a ride?

712
00:45:05,254 --> 00:45:06,755
What's up with your outfit?

713
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:08,382
You're not young anymore.

714
00:45:08,465 --> 00:45:09,550
What about it?

715
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:13,971
I look good. That's all I need.

716
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,313
You're late, Father.

717
00:45:24,648 --> 00:45:26,608
Did you have a drink, Father?

718
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:30,320
I literally had only one drink.
How did you know?

719
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:32,322
Were you with Father?

720
00:45:32,406 --> 00:45:33,949
No. We met in front of the house.

721
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:36,034
Where's Hye-jun? You went out with him.

722
00:45:36,118 --> 00:45:38,412
He's young and busy, unlike me.

723
00:45:39,663 --> 00:45:41,290
Hye-jun will be in a drama.

724
00:45:41,373 --> 00:45:43,333
It's a mini-series drama or something.

725
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:44,543
That's great!

726
00:45:45,752 --> 00:45:46,628
Really?

727
00:45:46,712 --> 00:45:49,256
Be good to him.
Don't let him resent you later.

728
00:45:49,339 --> 00:45:51,967
I don't deserve resentment.
I just scold him for his own good.

729
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,970
-Gosh, this guy.
-Goodness.

730
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,360
It feels surreal
that you're driving this truck.

731
00:46:11,486 --> 00:46:12,779
Why do you feel that?

732
00:46:15,282 --> 00:46:18,452
Your existence is just surreal.

733
00:46:20,454 --> 00:46:24,291
And being together right now
doesn't feel real, either.

734
00:46:28,211 --> 00:46:31,089
Can I take a photo?
I want to record this moment.

735
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:36,970
All right.

736
00:46:38,555 --> 00:46:40,766
One, two, three.

737
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,230
I'll make you feel this is real.

738
00:46:47,314 --> 00:46:48,315
How about a movie?

739
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:53,236
Sure. Let's watch a movie
nominated for the Academy Awards.

740
00:46:56,907 --> 00:46:59,326
-What are you doing?
-To walk you home.

741
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:00,952
Gosh, there's no need.

742
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:07,793
He never listens to me.

743
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:21,431
Did you notice it?

744
00:47:25,268 --> 00:47:26,436
It's not raining.

745
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:32,109
When it rains, I'll think of someone.

746
00:47:33,777 --> 00:47:34,611
Who?

747
00:47:36,571 --> 00:47:38,240
Should I answer it or not?

748
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:42,452
When you're not sure,
you should answer it.

749
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:46,331
I won't.

750
00:47:55,549 --> 00:47:56,633
Go inside.

751
00:47:57,175 --> 00:47:58,510
-After you go.
-No.

752
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:00,303
I'll see you go in.

753
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:03,849
I can't ever win, can I?

754
00:48:58,653 --> 00:48:59,946
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.

755
00:49:17,714 --> 00:49:19,090
Did you eat?

756
00:49:19,174 --> 00:49:21,510
I never skip my meals.
Three meals a day. You?

757
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,303
I always eat them, too.

758
00:49:25,138 --> 00:49:26,431
Even if I don't eat much.

759
00:49:27,057 --> 00:49:29,059
I wasn't sure eating popcorn this early

760
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:30,936
-would be good.
-I'm glad you got it.

761
00:49:34,606 --> 00:49:36,191
It's caramel popcorn.

762
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:38,401
I like caramel popcorn.
Do you not like it?

763
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:40,821
That's the best kind.

764
00:49:43,406 --> 00:49:45,200
Why isn't it starting? What time is it?

765
00:49:45,784 --> 00:49:46,993
I'll tell you.

766
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,501
It's 6:55 a.m.

767
00:49:56,336 --> 00:49:59,047
It's a watch for blind people.
I can tell time by touch.

768
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:01,216
I've never seen one.

769
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,469
This is for the minute.

770
00:50:05,637 --> 00:50:06,888
And this is for the hour.

771
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:09,724
Do you want to try it?

772
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:13,395
I want to live a life
that teaches me how others feel.

773
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:15,730
And this watch is one of my attempts.

774
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:20,110
Here.

775
00:51:08,617 --> 00:51:09,451
It's 7 a.m.

776
00:51:34,643 --> 00:51:35,894
CALLS

777
00:51:35,977 --> 00:51:37,938
HYE-JUN

778
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:50,992
I really need to tell Hye-jun.

779
00:51:55,538 --> 00:51:57,415
The longer I hesitate, the worse it is.

780
00:52:00,377 --> 00:52:01,378
Yes.

781
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:03,421
I've decided.

782
00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:05,340
I'll go back to sleep.

783
00:52:07,217 --> 00:52:09,594
REMEMBER TO GET VACCINATED
FOR CERVICAL CANCER

784
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,349
Today is the day.

785
00:52:16,017 --> 00:52:17,310
<i>I've got three stamps.</i>

786
00:52:25,527 --> 00:52:27,946
Look at you all glowing.

787
00:52:28,029 --> 00:52:30,073
Doesn't my skin look dry? I woke up early.

788
00:52:30,156 --> 00:52:33,743
I watched a movie with Jeong-ha at 7 a.m.
She has to work in the morning.

789
00:52:35,203 --> 00:52:36,788
Are you kidding me?

790
00:52:36,871 --> 00:52:40,875
If that's dry skin, I wish
I had your dry skin all year round.

791
00:52:44,796 --> 00:52:47,799
-When did it start with Jeong-ha?
-I know you have a girlfriend.

792
00:52:47,882 --> 00:52:49,426
Why can't you tell me?

793
00:52:49,509 --> 00:52:51,553
I really want to tell you, too.

794
00:52:52,178 --> 00:52:53,888
I really want to tell you, but…

795
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:57,809
This is driving me crazy.

796
00:53:00,228 --> 00:53:02,105
-Don't tell me.
-Why not?

797
00:53:02,188 --> 00:53:03,273
I don't want your pain.

798
00:53:03,857 --> 00:53:04,774
Darn you.

799
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:06,276
You.

800
00:53:07,235 --> 00:53:09,112
Me or Jeong-ha? Choose one.

801
00:53:09,821 --> 00:53:10,697
Jeong-ha.

802
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:15,702
I'm a fool for expecting loyalty from men.

803
00:53:15,785 --> 00:53:17,412
-What about you?
-I'd choose Hae-na.

804
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,581
Hey!

805
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:24,210
Have you gone mad? She's like your sister.

806
00:53:25,378 --> 00:53:28,298
-Don't tell him.
-Don't tell him I knew when he finds out.

807
00:53:31,426 --> 00:53:34,054
So this is the portfolio, right?
There are two.

808
00:53:34,137 --> 00:53:35,472
He can keep one of them.

809
00:53:36,389 --> 00:53:37,432
Thanks.

810
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,101
You'll make a polite corpse.

811
00:53:41,811 --> 00:53:44,314
-I will die?
-Probably. Hae-hyo will kill you.

812
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:01,414
-Hey.
-Hi.

813
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:06,878
Where are we going?
I don't want to go to a hotel.

814
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:08,546
What about a pension house?

815
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:10,465
I don't like it either.

816
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:14,052
Hae-na.

817
00:54:15,428 --> 00:54:19,307
-We don't have to go if you don't want to.
-We should go. I made a promise.

818
00:54:20,642 --> 00:54:22,977
I always keep my promises.

819
00:54:24,896 --> 00:54:26,356
Don't change your mind.

820
00:54:27,232 --> 00:54:28,525
Let's go.

821
00:54:30,235 --> 00:54:31,277
That must be the one.

822
00:54:34,114 --> 00:54:35,198
Right here.

823
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:45,041
-You can't even open it?
-I haven't been here a lot.

824
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:48,044
Let me do it. I've been here a lot.

825
00:54:48,128 --> 00:54:50,296
-What?
-With my family.

826
00:54:50,922 --> 00:54:52,173
With your family.

827
00:54:55,385 --> 00:54:59,097
I LOVE YOU, HAE-NA

828
00:54:59,806 --> 00:55:00,723
This is so childish.

829
00:55:01,516 --> 00:55:03,226
Didn't you know I was childish?

830
00:55:03,309 --> 00:55:04,853
Isn't that why you like me?

831
00:55:04,936 --> 00:55:07,730
Right. I like you
because you're not on my level.

832
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,818
Shall we drink champagne first?

833
00:55:12,902 --> 00:55:14,320
-No.
-No?

834
00:55:14,946 --> 00:55:17,157
Then, what do you want to do first?

835
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,325
I'm very goal-oriented.

836
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:20,869
We came here to achieve a goal.

837
00:55:46,978 --> 00:55:50,190
I've seen you ever since you were a kid.
I don't think this is right.

838
00:55:50,273 --> 00:55:51,608
It's like I'm violating you.

839
00:55:53,067 --> 00:55:56,487
You're still a kid.
Let's wait a bit longer.

840
00:55:56,571 --> 00:55:59,199
Let's have fun here. We can drink this

841
00:55:59,282 --> 00:56:01,034
-and watch a drama.
-You asshole!

842
00:56:01,951 --> 00:56:03,244
How could you call me that?

843
00:56:03,328 --> 00:56:05,747
You're not my brother!
Are we blood-related?

844
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,248
-Hae-na.
-Do you know

845
00:56:08,082 --> 00:56:10,376
how long I have been waiting for this day?

846
00:56:14,756 --> 00:56:15,840
Okay, fine.

847
00:56:15,924 --> 00:56:17,842
-Let's do it. I can do it.
-What?

848
00:56:20,136 --> 00:56:21,304
I don't want to anymore.

849
00:56:21,387 --> 00:56:23,556
Hae-na, I'm sorry.

850
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,682
Let go of me.

851
00:56:29,562 --> 00:56:31,189
You're not my brother,

852
00:56:31,272 --> 00:56:33,066
but a loser who can't grab his chance.

853
00:56:46,788 --> 00:56:49,707
Isn't it exhausting, Grandpa?
Don't overexert yourself.

854
00:56:52,293 --> 00:56:53,461
I'm not.

855
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,965
Besides, I'm enjoying it.

856
00:56:57,048 --> 00:56:58,424
Here's your portfolio.

857
00:56:59,008 --> 00:56:59,884
What?

858
00:57:00,426 --> 00:57:01,928
And keep this one as a memento.

859
00:57:06,683 --> 00:57:08,268
I look good.

860
00:57:10,478 --> 00:57:12,689
-You look dashing.
-Really?

861
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:15,775
Gosh, look at how handsome I am.

862
00:57:15,858 --> 00:57:18,027
Grandpa, dinner's ready!

863
00:57:18,111 --> 00:57:19,320
Hye-jun, let's hide it.

864
00:57:20,863 --> 00:57:22,073
Okay.

865
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,748
Mom, the side dishes look divine.

866
00:57:30,832 --> 00:57:33,084
Hye-jun was cast in a drama series.

867
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:35,878
His career must finally be taking off.
I'm thrilled.

868
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,725
-Thanks.
-You're in a drama series?

869
00:57:48,808 --> 00:57:50,768
-Which network?
-I don't know yet.

870
00:57:51,394 --> 00:57:53,896
You got cast,
but you don't even know that?

871
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,857
That's for his manager to handle.

872
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,276
The actor can know later on.

873
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:02,196
The apartment you rented
seems too cheap for the neighborhood.

874
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,823
Are you sure it's decent?

875
00:58:03,906 --> 00:58:05,366
Dad, don't you know who I am?

876
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:08,536
I managed to score a good deal
thanks to all the hunting I did.

877
00:58:09,078 --> 00:58:10,371
I trust you, of course.

878
00:58:11,164 --> 00:58:13,207
You're never the one to disappoint.

879
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:15,001
So you're moving next weekend.

880
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:16,502
Will you call a moving service?

881
00:58:16,586 --> 00:58:19,130
You should help him.
All the appliances are there anyway

882
00:58:19,213 --> 00:58:21,007
and he doesn't have a lot of stuff.

883
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:23,468
I can't that day. I have to work.

884
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:25,511
Then I'll help.

885
00:58:25,595 --> 00:58:27,388
Why? It'll only be exhausting.

886
00:58:27,889 --> 00:58:28,806
I'll do it.

887
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,850
But you're busy. Don't you have to film?

888
00:58:30,933 --> 00:58:32,810
We've yet to do the read-through.

889
00:58:34,562 --> 00:58:36,397
Even though the house is full of men,

890
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:38,524
you're the only one offering to help me.

891
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,235
Mom,

892
00:58:42,278 --> 00:58:43,863
that was distasteful.

893
00:58:43,946 --> 00:58:46,282
You made us look bad by complimenting him.

894
00:58:47,408 --> 00:58:49,702
You and your way with words.

895
00:59:02,256 --> 00:59:04,634
Enjoy. I made it for you, you know.

896
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:09,305
After dinner,
tell me all about your new series

897
00:59:09,389 --> 00:59:11,557
including the director and writer.

898
00:59:27,949 --> 00:59:32,829
<i>The number you've dialed is currently
unavailable. Please leave a voice message.</i>

899
00:59:33,329 --> 00:59:35,998
MIN-JAE

900
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:49,470
<i>The number you've dialed is currently
unavailable. Please leave a--</i>

901
01:00:31,512 --> 01:00:33,598
Just you wait, Yeong-nam.

902
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:35,975
Your dad is on his way!

903
01:00:59,624 --> 01:01:00,833
MIN-JAE

904
01:01:10,635 --> 01:01:11,511
I'm sorry.

905
01:01:15,097 --> 01:01:16,182
You should fire me.

906
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:31,447
I thought about it and…

907
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:35,243
I don't deserve to be your manager.

908
01:01:35,326 --> 01:01:38,538
I'm clumsy, moody,

909
01:01:39,205 --> 01:01:40,122
and nosy.

910
01:01:40,206 --> 01:01:41,791
And good at self-criticism.

911
01:01:41,874 --> 01:01:44,502
Will I ever be able to
be of any help to you?

912
01:01:44,585 --> 01:01:45,545
The premise is wrong.

913
01:01:47,129 --> 01:01:51,092
I believe people should work for their
own sake, not someone else's sake.

914
01:01:51,926 --> 01:01:54,387
-I know.
-They all say they do.

915
01:01:54,971 --> 01:01:57,098
Not doing as you know
is worse than ignorance.

916
01:02:02,937 --> 01:02:06,274
I would've stopped you
had I known that Mr. Lee was involved.

917
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:09,735
I didn't take this seriously enough.

918
01:02:10,653 --> 01:02:12,947
I'm not the one who got you
the movie, either.

919
01:02:14,866 --> 01:02:15,992
I'm useless.

920
01:02:16,784 --> 01:02:18,744
At least it served as a teaching moment.

921
01:02:20,413 --> 01:02:21,831
Everything comes with a cost.

922
01:02:22,582 --> 01:02:24,208
Thanks for saying that.

923
01:02:26,127 --> 01:02:29,088
You're quite admirable, though.
How can you be so calm?

924
01:02:30,298 --> 01:02:33,050
This isn't my first time,
so I know how to handle it.

925
01:02:35,136 --> 01:02:36,554
What pisses me off is that--

926
01:02:36,637 --> 01:02:38,180
Even though I apologized?

927
01:02:38,806 --> 01:02:40,975
People make mistakes and do wrong things.

928
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:43,019
What I hate is how you dodged me.

929
01:02:43,102 --> 01:02:45,146
A manager I can't get a hold of
is the worst.

930
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:47,398
Are you scolding me now?

931
01:02:47,481 --> 01:02:48,941
How can you tell me to fire you?

932
01:02:49,483 --> 01:02:50,776
That should come last.

933
01:02:51,485 --> 01:02:52,570
It was a joke.

934
01:02:56,115 --> 01:02:58,117
Or maybe you took
this industry too lightly.

935
01:03:06,334 --> 01:03:07,376
Min-jae,

936
01:03:10,296 --> 01:03:12,089
I don't have much time left.

937
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:15,217
Sometimes,

938
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:18,054
my laughter isn't real.

939
01:03:20,139 --> 01:03:21,182
<i>CATCH</i>

940
01:03:21,265 --> 01:03:22,767
It just isn't compelling enough.

941
01:03:23,601 --> 01:03:25,686
Why is Hae-hyo
only getting these lousy offers?

942
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:29,649
Yoon Ji-ho is the director,
and everyone's grabbing at it now.

943
01:03:29,732 --> 01:03:32,526
He already failed twice,
and the writer is a newbie.

944
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,362
This is a gamble for Hae-hyo.

945
01:03:34,445 --> 01:03:37,406
He's not exactly in the position
to pick and choose.

946
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:40,284
So all you bring him
is a small supporting role?

947
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,079
Are you people kidding me?

948
01:03:43,162 --> 01:03:45,748
Signing with a big agency
was all for nothing.

949
01:03:46,332 --> 01:03:48,668
I'm the one who snagged
Director Choi's movie,

950
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:50,920
but you people still took 50 percent.

951
01:03:51,712 --> 01:03:54,048
Anyway, unless you bring him
something worthy,

952
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:55,466
he won't renew his contract.

953
01:03:57,718 --> 01:03:58,678
Let's go.

954
01:04:01,847 --> 01:04:03,432
What a nice sight.

955
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:06,477
You look like her subordinate.

956
01:04:08,562 --> 01:04:09,563
Jeez.

957
01:04:15,736 --> 01:04:17,071
I'm exhausted.

958
01:04:17,655 --> 01:04:19,448
It's like I'm doing all the work.

959
01:04:20,992 --> 01:04:23,577
What will Hye-jun be up to
after the movie?

960
01:04:25,621 --> 01:04:27,164
A mini-series.

961
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:29,667
That's great. Which show is it?

962
01:04:30,835 --> 01:04:32,545
It's called <i>Catch</i>.

963
01:04:32,628 --> 01:04:33,462
What?

964
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:36,382
This one?

965
01:04:37,967 --> 01:04:39,301
<i>CATCH</i>

966
01:04:39,385 --> 01:04:41,595
Is Hae-hyo in the series too?

967
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:43,014
He's thinking about it.

968
01:04:43,097 --> 01:04:45,516
I didn't hear about Hye-jun, though.

969
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,309
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

970
01:04:47,393 --> 01:04:49,478
The leading role hasn't been cast yet,

971
01:04:49,562 --> 01:04:51,063
but Hye-jun already signed on?

972
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:55,526
I guess the supporting actors
could get cast first.

973
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:57,570
That's rarely the case.

974
01:04:57,653 --> 01:04:59,613
Some even get cut after the read-through.

975
01:04:59,697 --> 01:05:01,574
<i>Is she saying he'll get cut?</i>

976
01:05:06,662 --> 01:05:08,789
Hey, I wanted to ask you something.

977
01:05:08,873 --> 01:05:10,875
Has Hye-jun been cast in <i>Catch</i>?

978
01:05:11,834 --> 01:05:13,002
Right.

979
01:05:13,836 --> 01:05:15,087
Okay, got it.

980
01:05:16,881 --> 01:05:18,007
What was the answer?

981
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,719
It's news to them.

982
01:05:23,888 --> 01:05:26,140
I wonder why he said
he got the part though.

983
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:28,350
That's probably what he was told.

984
01:05:29,518 --> 01:05:31,771
Hye-jun will be so disappointed.

985
01:05:32,772 --> 01:05:36,067
Act like you know nothing
until he tells you first.

986
01:05:39,236 --> 01:05:42,156
B: NON-FICTION, ESSAYS

987
01:05:58,881 --> 01:06:03,385
"HOW SIMPLE AND FRUGAL
A THING IS HAPPINESS"

988
01:07:09,118 --> 01:07:11,078
Boy, this is hard.

989
01:07:12,746 --> 01:07:13,831
Hold on.

990
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:18,294
I should practice somewhere more spacious.

991
01:07:28,429 --> 01:07:29,513
All right.

992
01:07:30,222 --> 01:07:32,766
Lower the shoulders
and straighten the chest.

993
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:34,351
Here I go.

994
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:48,574
Sorry, I'm late. You must be hungry.

995
01:07:48,657 --> 01:07:49,783
No, it's fine.

996
01:07:49,867 --> 01:07:51,410
I'll be right out!

997
01:08:07,426 --> 01:08:09,970
Grandpa, what are you doing?

998
01:08:10,054 --> 01:08:12,097
Oh, it's nothing.

999
01:08:12,181 --> 01:08:13,515
You're home early today.

1000
01:08:14,058 --> 01:08:15,100
I always come at this hour.

1001
01:08:15,726 --> 01:08:17,519
Is that so? I see.

1002
01:08:25,861 --> 01:08:27,029
Grandpa!

1003
01:08:28,822 --> 01:08:30,532
Grandpa?

1004
01:08:30,616 --> 01:08:32,618
Mom!

1005
01:08:32,701 --> 01:08:33,786
-Father?
-Grandpa!

1006
01:08:33,869 --> 01:08:34,912
Father?

1007
01:08:34,995 --> 01:08:36,705
-Call an ambulance.
-Father!

1008
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:37,998
Grandpa!

1009
01:08:53,847 --> 01:08:54,932
Let me see.

1010
01:08:55,015 --> 01:08:56,934
<i>Father might have to stay a few days,</i>

1011
01:08:57,017 --> 01:08:58,269
<i>so pack a bag for him.</i>

1012
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,402
All right.

1013
01:09:08,112 --> 01:09:09,154
Got it.

1014
01:09:11,991 --> 01:09:12,992
There.

1015
01:09:14,368 --> 01:09:15,369
And this.

1016
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:19,206
I guess these are enough.

1017
01:09:19,873 --> 01:09:22,418
Will he need his pacemaker ID card?

1018
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:33,846
SA MIN-GI

1019
01:09:33,929 --> 01:09:34,972
What's this?

1020
01:09:58,370 --> 01:09:59,371
Unbelievable.

1021
01:10:08,297 --> 01:10:09,757
Grandpa, I saw that.

1022
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:14,136
-Did you?
-Are you all right, Father?

1023
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:16,764
Oh, well…

1024
01:10:17,389 --> 01:10:20,059
How can you be? You just collapsed.

1025
01:10:21,852 --> 01:10:23,020
You're finally up.

1026
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,563
He just woke up.

1027
01:10:24,646 --> 01:10:26,732
You can go home
once the IV drip is emptied.

1028
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,067
What caused this though?

1029
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:30,361
Was it his heart?

1030
01:10:30,444 --> 01:10:32,821
It would've been a lot worse
had it been his heart.

1031
01:10:32,905 --> 01:10:34,156
He's probably exhausted.

1032
01:10:34,782 --> 01:10:36,450
-Exhausted?
-What?

1033
01:10:56,762 --> 01:10:58,055
Why were you in there?

1034
01:10:59,098 --> 01:11:00,224
What's this?

1035
01:11:03,143 --> 01:11:04,686
I got him into a modeling academy.

1036
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:07,356
Instead of stopping him,
you encouraged him?

1037
01:11:08,023 --> 01:11:09,983
Do my words mean nothing to you?

1038
01:11:10,067 --> 01:11:11,151
Do they?

1039
01:11:13,487 --> 01:11:16,448
Grandpa wanted to work
so that he could help you.

1040
01:11:17,116 --> 01:11:18,200
That's why I did it.

1041
01:11:18,283 --> 01:11:21,161
So you got him hooked on a silly dream
like yours?

1042
01:11:21,245 --> 01:11:24,123
This is why I can never
stop worrying about you!

1043
01:11:25,457 --> 01:11:28,544
I gave up on going to college
because of Gyeong-jun.

1044
01:11:29,253 --> 01:11:31,171
I believed that one of us had to

1045
01:11:31,255 --> 01:11:34,216
since the tuition
was too much for you to bear.

1046
01:11:34,299 --> 01:11:35,551
I never asked that of you!

1047
01:11:35,634 --> 01:11:38,345
Gyeong-jun got good grades,
so I figured I had to.

1048
01:11:38,429 --> 01:11:40,431
My dream doesn't require a degree anyway.

1049
01:11:41,557 --> 01:11:42,975
Isn't that realistic enough?

1050
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:45,727
Why can't you see the sacrifice I made?

1051
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:47,062
Are you seeking credit?

1052
01:11:47,688 --> 01:11:50,941
You quit because you wanted to,
so who are you blaming?

1053
01:11:51,024 --> 01:11:54,194
This is why I call you a menace.
You're just like your grandpa!

1054
01:11:54,278 --> 01:11:57,698
How's that a bad thing?
It's way better than being like you.

1055
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:59,283
You darn brat!

1056
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:14,798
Did you just hit me?

1057
01:12:20,471 --> 01:12:21,305
Damn it.

1058
01:13:16,818 --> 01:13:20,697
JEONG-HA

1059
01:13:33,627 --> 01:13:34,753
Hi, Jeong-ha.

1060
01:13:35,754 --> 01:13:37,089
<i>Did you catch a cold?</i>

1061
01:13:38,674 --> 01:13:39,675
No.

1062
01:13:40,342 --> 01:13:43,053
<i>You sound like you have a cold.</i>

1063
01:13:43,136 --> 01:13:44,680
<i>I'm glad you don't though.</i>

1064
01:13:47,641 --> 01:13:48,850
<i>I'm bored.</i>

1065
01:13:49,685 --> 01:13:51,019
<i>Want to hang out with me?</i>

1066
01:13:55,566 --> 01:13:56,567
Sure.

1067
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:02,229
This place is awesome.

1068
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,107
You know a lot of nice places.

1069
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:08,527
I come here when I'm depressed.

1070
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,530
Were you depressed?

1071
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,407
Yes,

1072
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:16,035
but I'm not when I'm with you.

1073
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,788
I'm like your personal
anti-depressant then,

1074
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:23,083
so pay up.

1075
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,342
-For real?
-Yes.

1076
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,721
That's great. This is a lot though.

1077
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,681
I'm expecting the change.

1078
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:39,350
I'm keeping it.

1079
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:41,936
Yes, free money!

1080
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,437
Hey.

1081
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,067
Jeez, you're fast.

1082
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,110
Gosh.

1083
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:51,862
You should keep it.

1084
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:53,572
-Really?
-Yes.

1085
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:58,869
This place is really nice.

1086
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:09,755
There's a piano!

1087
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,050
As kids, weren't we all forced by our moms

1088
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:14,677
to take piano lessons?

1089
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:16,929
No.

1090
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:29,525
You know how to play.

1091
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:34,863
I taught myself, actually.

1092
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,117
That's how I learned most things.

1093
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:41,412
-So are you saying you're a genius?
-No, just poor.

1094
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:44,081
Can you play this?

1095
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,695
<i>Something magical happens
when you fall in love with a woman.</i>

1096
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,161
That was cool.

1097
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,873
<i>This particular woman has a name.</i>

1098
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:27,750
<i>An Jeong-ha.</i>

1099
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:06,955
<i>Searching for the stars</i>

1100
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:12,252
<i>Sparkling in the night sky</i>

1101
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:16,006
<i>I see your eyes blinking</i>

1102
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:20,302
<i>Oh, how beautiful they are</i>

1103
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:29,228
<i>I finally take the steps</i>

1104
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:34,399
<i>After hesitating over and over again</i>

1105
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:39,488
<i>And I will never forget</i>

1106
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:49,039
<i>How you held my hand</i>

1107
01:19:31,577 --> 01:19:38,858

1109
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:10,055
<i>I'm grateful to have you by my side
right now.</i>

1110
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:13,058
Hello, Mother.

1111
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,644
Hey, don't be startled.

1112
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,563
<i>I just wanted to live alone and feel free.</i>

1113
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,399
Forget about my duty as the eldest son.

1114
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,901
What have you ever done
for the family as the eldest son?

1115
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,278
-Mom.
-Shut it!

1116
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:26,154
What do people think of me here?

1117
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,615
I'll not let you have it your way.

1118
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:30,284
He wants a model-turned-actor.

1119
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,577
<i>I finish once I start something.</i>
