00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:05,796
RECORD OF YOUTH

2
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,358
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS AN
"EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT" AND IS SUPPORTED

3
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:09,045
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, TOURISM
AND THE KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

4
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:17,951
The answer is clear,

5
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:20,078
but I still don't know what to do.

6
00:00:20,662 --> 00:00:22,122
What's your answer?

7
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:25,000
To be like you, of course.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,923
What's up, guys?

9
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:33,926
-Did you invite him here?
-Yes.

10
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,430
Didn't you want me here?

11
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:39,848
-Switch places.
-Why?

12
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:41,642
Just get up already!

13
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:44,144
Now I'm the one who's pissed off.

14
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:45,562
What do you have against me?

15
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,815
Your mom's really scary.

16
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:49,525
You remind me of her.

17
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:51,819
Thinking about that day
still makes me shudder.

18
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:54,363
First my sister and now my mom?
You prick--

19
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:56,490
There's no need to get worked up over it.

20
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:58,575
Hae-na punched me more than enough.

21
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,161
-Like a brother, like a sister--
-She's nothing like me.

22
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,873
Damn it. Screw this.

23
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,168
I'm going home.

24
00:01:08,252 --> 00:01:10,587
But I just got here.

25
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,464
That's exactly why I'm going.

26
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,974
He must have gotten an earful from my mom.

27
00:01:22,558 --> 00:01:24,685
How does he expect
to date my sister like this?

28
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:27,187
He seems to have lost some weight.

29
00:01:28,897 --> 00:01:30,274
I doubt it's easy for him.

30
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:32,234
What about you?

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,070
Can you really let Jeong-ha go?

32
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,575
I still can't believe it.

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,870
We haven't been in contact much.

34
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:46,540
I still feel like I can meet her

35
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:48,292
if I just call her.

36
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:52,045
But when I'm reminded
of her last expression

37
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,008
it feels harder.

38
00:01:58,427 --> 00:01:59,511
The guilt is too much.

39
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:04,057
I'm sure that Jeong-ha
broke up with you for your sake.

40
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:06,643
Do you think so?

41
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:10,147
Because you would have to sacrifice a lot
if you chose her over your career.

42
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,440
You have a lot to lose.

43
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:17,112
But I can't stop thinking about

44
00:02:18,113 --> 00:02:20,657
how I can be of any comfort

45
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,243
or be significant to anyone

46
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,704
when I can't even protect someone I love.

47
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:30,792
Those who love and support me must believe

48
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:34,338
that I'll protect them

49
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,758
like I protected Jeong-ha.

50
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,056
Truth prevails, right?

51
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:05,619
<i>Neither of us said anything.</i>

52
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:08,288
<i>Words weren't exchanged,</i>

53
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:12,584
<i>but we remember everything
down to all the small movements.</i>

54
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:25,372
RECORD OF YOUTH

55
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,019
Have you been well?

56
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,066
I've been trying to.

57
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:41,613
Congrats on the success
of your recent show.

58
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:44,574
I was worried a little

59
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,952
because the scandals dropped the ratings.

60
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:50,872
But I guess you were meant
to find success.

61
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,050
It's not raining anymore.

62
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:04,011
It stopped around the time we got here.

63
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,479
I need some air.

64
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:35,417
FINALE

65
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,220
In movies and dramas,

66
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:50,182
there's always foreshadowing
before something important happens.

67
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:56,938
But you skipped all that
and ended our relationship.

68
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:59,691
At least tell me what I did wrong
so that I can change.

69
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:04,237
You did nothing wrong.

70
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:06,490
Then why did you dump me all of a sudden?

71
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:09,701
-Are you upset?
-Yes.

72
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:12,788
Wanting to protect someone

73
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:14,748
isn't an old-fashioned notion.

74
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,834
It's a general emotion that we feel
toward a loved one.

75
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:21,171
I was grateful for how you wanted to

76
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,673
care for and protect me.

77
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,553
I only called it old-fashioned

78
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:32,724
because it made me want to lean on you.

79
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,684
Then you can.

80
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,233
I'm against being dependent on others.

81
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,360
It reminds me of my mom.

82
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,405
I need a little more time.

83
00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:52,494
I hate unpredictable people,

84
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:57,833
and I've learned that this could
make me become one too.

85
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:03,130
I don't like those who generate anxiety,

86
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:07,467
but now I learned
that I could be that way too.

87
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,972
I love keeping promises,

88
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,226
but I learned how I could become a person

89
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:18,812
who sometimes can't.

90
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:24,568
I used to love stability,
but now I'm fond of instability too.

91
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:29,698
Being in love with you
changed me to be more complicated.

92
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,826
And I actually like it.

93
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,831
Being with you
helped me grow as a person too.

94
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:39,833
You were able to fulfill your dream,

95
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:42,169
but I'm just getting started.

96
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:51,386
Our timing is just off.

97
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,973
Forcing it to be synchronized

98
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,267
will drive us apart.

99
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,728
I'll try harder.

100
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:04,983
This is exactly why
I wanted to protect you.

101
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:12,491
I love you.

102
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,751
I know.

103
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:28,340
All that's left

104
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:32,677
is for us to respectfully part ways.

105
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:35,388
You were with me when my dreams came true,

106
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,309
so why can't I do the same?

107
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,729
The emotions I learned from being in love,

108
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,857
and my outlook on life.

109
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:52,447
That's your gift to me,
and that's more than enough.

110
00:07:55,116 --> 00:07:57,536
I want to be remembered
as a beautiful memory.

111
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:03,583
Promise me that you'll remember

112
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,255
the time we spent together.

113
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:45,333
Okay.

114
00:08:46,835 --> 00:08:48,044
Okay.

115
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:51,506
Good.

116
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,633
Could you move more dynamically this time?

117
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:56,761
All right.

118
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:00,515
That doesn't seem natural at all.

119
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,601
Let's check the photos.

120
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,146
Hey. You should put those down.

121
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:07,355
-Aren't they heavy?
-Yes.

122
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:13,111
Sir, he looks good head-on,
but he looks better from the side.

123
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,197
I know.

124
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,199
Just leave it to me, okay?

125
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:22,370
Are you his manager?

126
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:24,956
-Yes.
-You must be very fond of your model.

127
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:28,084
We're good here,
so change into the next outfit.

128
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:32,631
-Want some water?
-No, I'm good.

129
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:38,219
You look down today.

130
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,512
Are you sick?

131
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:41,222
No, I'm good.

132
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,310
Are you acquaintances?

133
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,522
He's Hye-jun's father
and that's his grandfather.

134
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:50,940
Hye-jun's father…

135
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:53,401
Hye-jun?

136
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,570
Sa Hye-jun?

137
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:01,159
Yes, hello.

138
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,955
Jin-u already knows,
but I'm good at headshots and--

139
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,166
If the job brings in cash, he's your man.

140
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,794
-He wants to work with Hye-jun.
-I see.

141
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:16,508
Are you cutting me off
because you're quitting soon?

142
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,635
-Are you quitting?
-I want to pave my own way.

143
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,345
I can't work for others forever.

144
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,764
Others? Is that what you think of me?

145
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,228
He's only quitting because
he's friends with Hye-jun and Hae-hyo.

146
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:29,979
He thinks they'll work with him.

147
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:33,650
But Mr. Sa, the photos
I took of your father

148
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,318
will prove how talented I am.

149
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:40,198
That being said, could you perhaps
put in a good word for me

150
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:41,616
with Hye-jun?

151
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:43,701
I'm afraid I'm not that good with words.

152
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:46,746
I understand what you mean,

153
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,541
but I can still find the right words
when needed.

154
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,171
Honestly, sir. That rejection was like
a stab to the chest.

155
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,340
Rather than Hye-jun,

156
00:10:57,424 --> 00:11:00,301
let me introduce you to the model
I have high hopes for.

157
00:11:00,802 --> 00:11:04,180
-In five years, he'll make it big.
-Mr. Sa, that's ridiculous.

158
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,723
It'll only take three.

159
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:08,184
Jin-u, once you open your studio,

160
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,353
I'll only do shoots there.

161
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,398
But that's unfair. Shouldn't you--

162
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:14,941
He's just using his connections.

163
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:18,695
Jin-u, I'll put in a good word for you
with Hye-jun.

164
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,197
-Thank you.
-But how is that fair?

165
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:25,118
Mr. Yang, I've known Jin-u
for nearly 30 years.

166
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:28,037
We shared time, emotions, and even money
over those 30 years.

167
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:31,207
He shouldn't be on the same level
as someone I met three hours ago.

168
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,001
You work on your own connections.

169
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:35,253
It's all we have in the end, right?

170
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,965
Then let me join you.

171
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:41,676
-What's Hye-jun up to today?
-Hey, go back to work.

172
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:44,179
Mr. Sa, could you stand in the center?

173
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,266
Come in.

174
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:50,435
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

175
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,731
We could have just talked over the phone.

176
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,650
A lawsuit is a pretty big deal.

177
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,611
I should deliver the news in person.

178
00:12:00,528 --> 00:12:02,822
This is for when you need a sugar rush.

179
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:04,073
Right, thanks.

180
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,912
This is so that Hye-jun
will renew his contract with you.

181
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,538
Not at all.

182
00:12:10,622 --> 00:12:12,832
Can't you change the name of your agency?

183
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,418
No! Why must you…

184
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:21,090
I mean,

185
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:24,719
Gyeong-jun, the complainant
has dropped the charges.

186
00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:26,638
The case will be closed soon.

187
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:31,017
Why do people get upset
when they get called out?

188
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,187
I've met a fair share of people
in the generous years I've lived,

189
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,607
and you definitely have
somewhat of an odd personality.

190
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:40,443
Is that a compliment?

191
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,153
It is.

192
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,822
Let me tell you something.

193
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:47,325
Try to keep a straight face
if you're going to lie.

194
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,662
"It is." Is this good enough?

195
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:53,540
Yes, I guess that will do.
Anyway, do you want to have lunch?

196
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:55,875
Why is he being nice? Fine, let's go.

197
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,088
It's from a department store.

198
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:01,673
It was pricey.

199
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,842
I've never received chocolates before.

200
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:11,432
<i>THE PRESENT</i>

201
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:42,130
CONTRACT

202
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:48,094
CEO: LEE MIN-JAE

203
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,554
SA HYE-JUN

204
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:51,264
<i>I may seem nonchalant, but I'm not.</i>

205
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:53,892
<i>If you say you'll leave,
I'll beg you not to.</i>

206
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:56,477
Hye-jun.

207
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,654
I made <i>gimbap</i>, your favorite.

208
00:14:06,738 --> 00:14:08,865
You can never go wrong with <i>gimbap</i>.

209
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,116
What were you reading?

210
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:12,243
-My contract.
-I see.

211
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:15,914
If Jeong-ha's less busy now,

212
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:18,124
let's reschedule.

213
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:24,297
What's wrong? Did you two argue?

214
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:26,883
No.

215
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:30,470
Even if I want to,
she won't engage in an argument.

216
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,099
Did you two break up?

217
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:45,193
<i>THE FIRST HUMAN</i> ENDS
WITH 21.5 PERCENT IN RATINGS

218
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:47,528
And Sa Hye-jun lives to tell the tale.

219
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:52,116
How do I get him to sign with me?

220
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:57,580
Tae-su.

221
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,041
I'm in trouble.

222
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:03,753
<i>You moron. You're such a pain in my ass.</i>

223
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:06,631
-In what way?
-Remember Min-jeong?

224
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:08,299
She's blackmailing me.

225
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:09,676
Who's Min-jeong?

226
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:12,470
That must be her. I told her to come here.

227
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:13,638
Come in.

228
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:16,641
Hello, sweeties.

229
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:20,311
<i>I basically feed you girls.</i>

230
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:24,607
-Wait, is someone going to give us a meal?
-We can pay money for a meal ourselves.

231
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,025
I don't mooch off anyone.

232
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:29,320
You're so dense.

233
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:30,571
What are you doing here?

234
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,117
Do-ha said we should talk to you instead.

235
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:36,411
Talk about what?

236
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:40,540
I may work at a hostess bar,
but that doesn't mean you can insult me.

237
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:42,291
When did I insult you?

238
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,419
You said I was dense, did you not?

239
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:46,129
But you are.

240
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,213
Facts aren't insults.

241
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,841
I'm not the only one.
You're just as dense as I am.

242
00:15:49,924 --> 00:15:51,050
Do-ha.

243
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:53,094
We should talk.

244
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,479
She wants 500 million won to settle.

245
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,607
-Take care of it.
-What did you do with her?

246
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:09,318
This is all your fault.
You said it was a safe place.

247
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:13,197
Little did I know
that you'd become a regular there.

248
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:16,784
I never do anything halfheartedly.

249
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:19,370
Technically, it's your fault
for taking me there.

250
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,083
Show me all the texts and calls
you exchanged with her.

251
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:34,552
Where's your recording device?
Is it your phone?

252
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,014
I know you're recording this.

253
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:46,647
Who put you up to this?

254
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:48,649
Was this your idea?

255
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:50,109
As if.

256
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:54,655
I've shared all the communication
that Do-ha engaged in with me.

257
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:57,325
I could report you to the cops.

258
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,660
Sweetie, have you learned nothing
from celebrities

259
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:02,205
who went downhill
after a scandal like this?

260
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,499
This is something you need to silence.

261
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:06,125
If not, then call the cops.

262
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,336
-I have nothing to lose.
-As if.

263
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:10,630
You'll have to spend time in prison. You…

264
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,592
You're being recorded.

265
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:20,556
It won't be boring since your friends
will be joining you though.

266
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,603
I checked the texts and photos
that you two exchanged.

267
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,607
You're right.
It would hurt Do-ha's career.

268
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,817
But

269
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:34,445
he's not married
and he doesn't have a girlfriend,

270
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:35,863
so what's the issue?

271
00:17:35,947 --> 00:17:36,948
Tell me.

272
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:40,993
Is it a crime to fall in love
with a girl who works at a bar?

273
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:46,582
Get lost.

274
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,304
Where are you off to?

275
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:02,306
I'm going to the library.

276
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,350
Be back before dinner then.

277
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,686
I'm going to Hae-hyo's early tomorrow,

278
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,146
so I might miss you.

279
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:21,659
I want you to stop working at Hae-hyo's.

280
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:25,329
-Why?
-Your son is rich now.

281
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:29,125
You being rich has nothing to do
with me having a job.

282
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,042
It does.

283
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:35,715
One of the reasons I wanted to earn money
was to provide an easy life for you.

284
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:40,845
-I don't want to be indebted to you.
-What if your health worsens?

285
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,224
You complain about
your bad knees and back.

286
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:46,851
I never did such a thing.

287
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:49,395
You groan when getting up from a chair

288
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:51,939
and massage your back often.

289
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:56,861
Mom,

290
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,406
if you love me,

291
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,701
please do what I want this time.

292
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:19,300
I want to thank everyone
for subscribing to my channel.

293
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:23,596
This will be the last video I upload.

294
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:27,767
I haven't been invested
in the channel much,

295
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,936
but most of all,
my view on life has changed.

296
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:32,230
<i>Instead of wanting a stable life,</i>

297
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:34,440
<i>I've decided to enjoy
the current instability.</i>

298
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:40,738
<i>I thank everyone
who has helped me grow as a person.</i>

299
00:19:48,496 --> 00:19:53,376
FULL MAKEUP COUPON

300
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:04,887
I had no idea you had won this coupon.

301
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,264
What are you filming today?

302
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:07,723
Nothing.

303
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:09,767
Then why use the coupon?

304
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:12,561
As an excuse.

305
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,273
You probably find me uncomfortable now.

306
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:17,566
I do.

307
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:20,486
But I still need to work,
so I won't reject clients.

308
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:21,946
That's the An Jeong-ha I know.

309
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,532
Use the coupon another day.

310
00:20:24,615 --> 00:20:26,158
Do you have any upcoming projects?

311
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:28,703
No. I'm enlisting instead.

312
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:31,998
The military?

313
00:20:33,124 --> 00:20:34,542
I guess you have to.

314
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,757
<i>I have the day off,
so let's shoot some hoops tonight.</i>

315
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,260
<i>Basketball only gets better after dark.</i>

316
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:47,221
<i>You work till late,
so tell us when to meet.</i>

317
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:24,675
Aren't you guys busy?

318
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,801
You keep calling me.

319
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,678
And you come out whenever we call you.

320
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:29,764
You guys are famous. I'm not like you.

321
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:32,350
I'm not famous. Hye-jun is famous.

322
00:21:34,852 --> 00:21:36,270
He didn't deny it.

323
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:39,398
He knows he's famous, too.

324
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:40,816
What's next for you?

325
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,109
Next?

326
00:21:43,152 --> 00:21:45,446
-I'm not sure.
-That's not a workaholic's answer.

327
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,407
I might enlist now.

328
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:51,577
-Are you crazy? Don't be ridiculous.
-Why is that ridiculous?

329
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,370
You didn't go when people pushed you.

330
00:21:53,454 --> 00:21:55,831
If you go now, you have a lot to lose.
Why would you?

331
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:58,834
I've always thought about it.
It's not a sudden decision.

332
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,878
Same here.

333
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:03,756
You can afford to take a break now,
but not Hye-jun.

334
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,134
I told you to postpone it
as much as you can.

335
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,597
Money is one thing,
but you'll be 30 when you're done.

336
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,016
You won't be able to play
a young character.

337
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,104
Hey, I'm asking
because I'm really curious.

338
00:22:18,187 --> 00:22:21,357
How much does a top star
like Hye-jun make a year?

339
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,610
-I wouldn't know. I'm not a top star.
-I don't want to discuss it.

340
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:27,113
I won't ask you for money.
Come on, tell me.

341
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:28,989
Gosh, I should go home.

342
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:31,909
I have an early morning
for an honorary ambassador gig.

343
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:34,912
Go ahead. I'm going to talk to him.

344
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:36,705
Bye.

345
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:39,083
What is it?

346
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,292
Come with me.

347
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,026
<i>I fulfilled my dream,</i>

348
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:09,113
<i>but I still have one homework left.</i>

349
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:25,337
<i>The faster you finish your homework,
the more relieved you become.</i>

350
00:23:41,611 --> 00:23:45,031
Hye-jun told me to quit my job.
What should I do?

351
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:47,158
Must you think about it?

352
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:48,743
Just quit.

353
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:49,828
What?

354
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:53,414
He paid back our debt.

355
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,875
And he bought the house,
so we don't pay rent.

356
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,168
We should listen to him.

357
00:23:58,628 --> 00:24:01,297
You are very realistic.

358
00:24:01,381 --> 00:24:05,093
It must be embarrassing to accept his help
given how you treated him back then.

359
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:07,136
I should admit it when I'm wrong.

360
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,514
Come in.

361
00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:11,808
When did you come home?

362
00:24:11,891 --> 00:24:13,059
Just now.

363
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:15,603
Let's have a family meeting.

364
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:16,813
Set a date and tell me.

365
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,773
Do we need a family meeting?

366
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,900
-What is it about?
-I'll tell you then.

367
00:24:23,736 --> 00:24:24,946
What is this about?

368
00:24:25,572 --> 00:24:26,656
I don't know.

369
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:33,496
Even if my mom was horrible to you,

370
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:36,165
don't hate her.

371
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:38,793
I don't hate her. She's Hae-na's mother.

372
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,588
Hey, do you put Hae-na before me?

373
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:44,757
Yes, I do. Do you think I'd put you first?

374
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,265
I'll support you
regardless of the decision you make.

375
00:24:52,348 --> 00:24:54,434
Of course, you should.
Don't brag about it.

376
00:24:54,517 --> 00:24:56,561
You sound like
you're going away or something.

377
00:24:57,437 --> 00:25:02,025
This was my way of trying
to be civil about my feelings.

378
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:04,903
-But you were annoying earlier.
-How so?

379
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:07,739
You said I can enlist now
when Hye-jun shouldn't.

380
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:10,909
Are you saying that
because my career didn't take off?

381
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:12,911
Yes, this is more like you.

382
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:15,580
Oh, no. Hae-hyo, did I hurt your feelings?

383
00:25:15,663 --> 00:25:18,082
I'm sorry. Have a shot.

384
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,084
Don't talk like that again.

385
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:22,086
Sure. I'll talk like that again.

386
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,212
Pour me a shot, too.

387
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:32,722
-Did you drink?
-Yes.

388
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:35,391
Who were you with?

389
00:25:35,475 --> 00:25:37,602
With the guys. Hye-jun and Jin-u.

390
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:39,145
Your friends?

391
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:42,649
Goodness. I can't believe you.

392
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:43,983
I just don't get you.

393
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:46,319
Aren't you upset when you see Hye-jun?

394
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,658
Yes, I get upset. I even get angry.

395
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:56,329
I think, "I tried my best,
but why didn't my career take off?

396
00:25:56,412 --> 00:25:58,206
What does he have that I don't have?"

397
00:25:58,873 --> 00:25:59,999
I come up with nothing.

398
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:03,878
When Hye-jun and I were out together,

399
00:26:04,712 --> 00:26:07,173
I used to be the center of attention.

400
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:08,549
But not anymore.

401
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,386
How do you think I feel?

402
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:14,764
But Mom,

403
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:18,977
I like myself.

404
00:26:20,603 --> 00:26:22,230
I'm not a loser, at least.

405
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,777
I wished the best for Hye-jun,

406
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,321
and I was truly happy for him
when things worked out.

407
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:34,200
I didn't let his success
make me feel inferior.

408
00:26:34,283 --> 00:26:36,536
And I still believe that I can make it.

409
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,666
You raised a good son.

410
00:26:44,377 --> 00:26:46,295
You didn't fail.

411
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,820
You were gloomy earlier.

412
00:27:10,903 --> 00:27:12,363
But you seem happy now.

413
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:15,283
It turns out I raised a great son.

414
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:17,493
Hae-hyo is very good-natured.

415
00:27:17,577 --> 00:27:20,121
Are you rationalizing your failure?

416
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:23,708
Once his contract matures with his agency,

417
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:26,961
I should step in and take the reigns.

418
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,504
Tell him to go back to studying.

419
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:32,216
He needs at least a master's degree
to get a position at our school.

420
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:36,721
Yeong-Won-Hae Entertainment.

421
00:27:36,804 --> 00:27:40,558
What do you think?
It's named after our names.

422
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:43,895
Hae-na can be the legal advisor
for our agency.

423
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:44,979
Whatever.

424
00:27:45,646 --> 00:27:47,982
You never give up. Goodness.

425
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,401
How can I give up on my children?

426
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:53,321
Why are you in my room?

427
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:55,281
I don't have a TV in my room,

428
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:57,158
but I don't want to go downstairs.

429
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,327
I was with Jin-u.

430
00:28:01,788 --> 00:28:02,663
I'm neutral.

431
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,541
That means you're on Mom's side.

432
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:09,128
I know that Mom has sway over you
and you fall under her influence.

433
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:11,172
-Are you any different?
-No!

434
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:13,758
I'm even worse.

435
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,719
I want to go shopping with Mom.

436
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,680
I want my life back.

437
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,517
I'll support you
regardless of the decision you make.

438
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,727
I bet that's what you said to Jin-u, too.

439
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:25,853
Right.

440
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:28,439
It's up to you to choose,

441
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:30,066
and I'll support you for it.

442
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,038
-Hi.
-Put on your seatbelt.

443
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,123
Okay.

444
00:28:53,464 --> 00:28:56,217
Is there anything I can do to help
with your studio?

445
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:00,638
Study hard and become a lawyer.

446
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:03,975
How is that helping you?

447
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:06,436
That way, we'll both be busy,

448
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:08,771
so it will be easier
even if we can't meet.

449
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,107
Why can't we meet?

450
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:16,154
Go back to your life now.

451
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:18,990
We loved each other.

452
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:21,409
That's all I need.

453
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,413
Right now,

454
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:30,168
we aren't strong enough to go against
our parents and our environments

455
00:29:31,252 --> 00:29:32,628
to protect our relationship.

456
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:42,013
Don't cry.

457
00:29:44,223 --> 00:29:45,558
I'm not crying.

458
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:17,089
You have an interview after the ceremony.

459
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:19,342
<i>The ceremony is about to begin.</i>

460
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:22,470
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

461
00:30:26,015 --> 00:30:28,893
SOCIAL WELFARE SOCIETY
HONORARY AMBASSADOR APPOINTMENT

462
00:30:35,191 --> 00:30:38,319
<i>Every drama you were in
has become a hit so far.</i>

463
00:30:38,402 --> 00:30:39,695
Is there a secret behind it?

464
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:43,241
More than anything, it was possible
thanks to the viewers' support.

465
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:45,826
And all the staff and the cast members
did a great job,

466
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,745
so I think that's why it was possible.

467
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:52,458
I see. Lastly, can you tell your fans
about the plans you have for the future?

468
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,504
Nothing has been decided yet.

469
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:58,881
I'm just doing my best
to enjoy the present moment.

470
00:31:00,174 --> 00:31:02,301
-Ae-suk.
-Hey.

471
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:04,637
You're delivering the side dishes today.

472
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,473
She asked me to cook braised hairtail,
so I brought the sauce

473
00:31:07,557 --> 00:31:08,808
and marsh snails for soup.

474
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:10,017
Okay. You can cook here.

475
00:31:10,726 --> 00:31:12,478
Where is she?

476
00:31:12,562 --> 00:31:14,272
Today is my last day. I'm quitting.

477
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:16,148
Why? Are you sick of it?

478
00:31:16,232 --> 00:31:19,610
No. Jin-u won't let me work for her.
He keeps complaining.

479
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:21,696
I started working as a hobby,

480
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,532
so I don't want it to upset him.

481
00:31:25,658 --> 00:31:27,743
I guess Hye-jun wasn't the only one.

482
00:31:28,744 --> 00:31:29,912
Come in.

483
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,083
You're here.

484
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:38,713
I made braised hairtail
and marsh snail soup.

485
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,340
You should have cooked it later,
so it's good for dinner.

486
00:31:41,424 --> 00:31:44,010
<i>I'm so glad I decided to quit.</i>

487
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:47,847
I think you need to find another cook.

488
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,766
I can't work for you anymore.

489
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,310
<i>Jin-u must have talked to her.</i>

490
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,314
Okay. Thank you for everything.

491
00:31:56,397 --> 00:31:57,481
<i>She won't even stop me.</i>

492
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,318
Okay. Goodbye.

493
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:02,194
Please don't be offended by it.

494
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:06,032
I'm sure you would have done the same
thing if you were in my shoes.

495
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:10,161
I don't think I'm following you.

496
00:32:10,244 --> 00:32:12,830
Why would I be offended?
And what would I do the same?

497
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:17,084
I thought Jin-u talked to you.

498
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,129
<i>Her ego must have been hurt
because Jin-u asked me to quit.</i>

499
00:32:20,212 --> 00:32:21,881
<i>But she's twisting her words.</i>

500
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:24,925
He did talk to me.

501
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:27,803
<i>She doesn't seem angry at all.
What is this?</i>

502
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:30,765
Actually, that's what
I wanted to tell you.

503
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,351
Please don't be offended by this.

504
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:34,769
My son told me to quit

505
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:38,939
because this job might be taxing on me
and he's worried about my health.

506
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:42,860
I get that your pride is hurt,
but let's get this straight. Okay?

507
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,904
Then, goodbye.

508
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:51,786
Goodness. What was that?

509
00:33:11,347 --> 00:33:13,641
The braised hairtail is done,
so I turned it off.

510
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:16,811
Thank you. I was waiting for her to leave.

511
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:21,273
Well…

512
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:22,900
What is it?

513
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,194
It's nothing. It can wait.

514
00:33:25,277 --> 00:33:29,156
Go ahead. If you don't tell me after that,
I'll be more curious.

515
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:34,120
I think I need to quit.

516
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,039
Why are you doing this to me?

517
00:33:37,123 --> 00:33:39,500
I'll give you some time.
Try to find someone else.

518
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,670
Did you plan it with Gyeong-mi,
so you can make things hard for me?

519
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,673
It's sad that she quit,
but I can handle it.

520
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:47,675
But I can't lose you.

521
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:51,846
That's why I wanted to keep working here,
but it's because of Hye-jun…

522
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:55,766
<i>I have nothing to say to that.</i>

523
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,519
He wants me to quit
because it's too much work for me.

524
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:00,730
I know that you have money,

525
00:34:00,813 --> 00:34:03,774
and I know it won't work
even if I offer you more money.

526
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:07,445
Is he the only one that matters?
Do I not mean anything to you?

527
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,490
<i>What's she saying?
It's not like we're dating each other.</i>

528
00:34:11,574 --> 00:34:13,534
I'll finish my work quickly and go home.

529
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:14,994
Do whatever you want.

530
00:34:15,494 --> 00:34:16,787
But just don't quit.

531
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,093
My gosh. Who is this guy?

532
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:32,344
Did you just finish?

533
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:35,681
You're doing great, Yeong-nam.
You look dashing.

534
00:34:35,765 --> 00:34:37,475
Aren't you glad you listened to me?

535
00:34:37,558 --> 00:34:40,478
This is only part-time.
My father doesn't have a lot of work yet.

536
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,104
I'm sure he'll do well.

537
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:45,107
Don't discourage him
like you did to Hye-jun.

538
00:34:45,191 --> 00:34:46,400
I won't do that.

539
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:48,569
Here.

540
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:50,321
What's this?

541
00:34:50,404 --> 00:34:53,115
My father did an ad for a health drink.
I got a box.

542
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,242
-I put it aside for you.
-Thanks.

543
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,369
I would invite you to my home
and have dinner,

544
00:34:57,453 --> 00:34:58,871
but we have a family meeting.

545
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:00,164
Dad.

546
00:35:00,247 --> 00:35:01,457
Hey.

547
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,833
Hello.

548
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:05,878
Gyeong-jun, when are you getting married?

549
00:35:07,254 --> 00:35:10,174
If you ask such questions to singles,
you get a fine nowadays.

550
00:35:10,257 --> 00:35:11,425
It starts at 10,000 won.

551
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,511
I won't ask.

552
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,638
-You did. Pay up.
-Gosh.

553
00:35:15,721 --> 00:35:17,515
Bye, Yeong-nam.

554
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:18,974
-Bye.
-Bye.

555
00:35:19,058 --> 00:35:20,810
-Bye.
-Thanks, Yeong-nam!

556
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:21,977
Sure. Bye.

557
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:32,446
-Did you take a shower?
-Yes.

558
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,202
Why are we having a family meeting today?
Tell me first.

559
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,412
Why?

560
00:35:40,496 --> 00:35:44,416
Well, you know…
Is this about buying a car for Grandpa?

561
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,544
Does he want a car?

562
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,505
No. I just thought

563
00:35:49,588 --> 00:35:53,092
you called for a meeting
to upgrade the car Dad has.

564
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:55,803
I can just do it.
We don't need a family meeting for that.

565
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:00,641
Do you want a car?

566
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:04,478
Gosh. Why would I want a car?
I'm a mere employee.

567
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:08,899
I like SUVs.

568
00:36:08,983 --> 00:36:10,276
Buy it yourself.

569
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:12,194
-How will I do that?
-You're working, aren't you?

570
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:18,409
Hye-jun, you definitely
need a financial advisor.

571
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:20,244
You have to make investments.

572
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:22,121
This house wasn't a good investment.

573
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:24,665
You should've bought one on the other
side. Redevelopment takes forever.

574
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:26,917
Then, I would have taken out a loan.

575
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:29,545
You're supposed to buy a house
with a mortgage loan.

576
00:36:29,628 --> 00:36:31,797
I don't like loans.
Remember what Dad said?

577
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:34,341
There's always interest to pay
even if you don't work.

578
00:36:36,385 --> 00:36:37,595
Can't I go back to school?

579
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:39,847
Go ahead. Why are you asking me?
It's your life.

580
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,931
I don't want to work.

581
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:44,018
What do you want to tell me?

582
00:36:46,562 --> 00:36:49,023
-I want to be adopted as your son.
-Gosh.

583
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,442
I'm just jealous.
Let's go upstairs and eat.

584
00:36:58,032 --> 00:37:02,077
It's been a while
since we all had a meal together.

585
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:04,413
I hope we can have family meetings often.

586
00:37:05,706 --> 00:37:06,707
What is it about?

587
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,710
Yes, I'm curious, too. What is this about?

588
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:13,797
I'm going to enlist.

589
00:37:19,762 --> 00:37:21,221
Did you get drafted?

590
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,514
-No.
-Hey.

591
00:37:22,598 --> 00:37:24,934
Postpone it until you can.
Why would you go now?

592
00:37:25,017 --> 00:37:26,101
I have to go anyway.

593
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:28,771
He didn't go when we pushed him,
but he wants to go now.

594
00:37:28,854 --> 00:37:31,899
But things worked out because
he didn't go when we pushed him to.

595
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:34,652
You have to work while you can.

596
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:36,236
You should be working now.

597
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,155
You'll lose the momentum if you go.

598
00:37:38,238 --> 00:37:39,281
What momentum?

599
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:41,408
What? I mean…

600
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:44,078
Fine. Let's say you took a break
from eating <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

601
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,955
Do you want to continue eating it?

602
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,122
No, it'd be soggy.

603
00:37:47,206 --> 00:37:50,000
Why would you use that example?
Am I a <i>jjajangmyeon</i>?

604
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:52,086
You became famous overnight,

605
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,380
and you don't have a strong fan base now.

606
00:37:54,463 --> 00:37:57,841
When you come back, you'll get old
and might have to start from the bottom.

607
00:37:57,925 --> 00:37:59,885
It's not just about that.

608
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:02,554
You worked so hard
to achieve what you have now.

609
00:38:02,638 --> 00:38:05,766
People finally recognize your talent
and are supporting you.

610
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:07,476
This is fun for you.

611
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,813
I want you to join the military
after enjoying it as much as you can.

612
00:38:11,397 --> 00:38:14,316
Once you come back from the military,
you won't be young anymore.

613
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,777
You don't have to be
in your 20s to be young.

614
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,112
He has a point.

615
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,488
I'm in my 70s,

616
00:38:19,571 --> 00:38:21,031
-but I still feel young.
-Grandpa.

617
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:22,449
Father.

618
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:26,829
-If we're against it, will you not go?
-No.

619
00:38:26,912 --> 00:38:28,455
Why are you asking us then?

620
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,874
I didn't ask.
I just announced that I was going to.

621
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:34,086
You can be so stubborn at times.

622
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:37,047
-He takes after you.
-What have I done?

623
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:39,508
Look at him. He always tells us
after he decides.

624
00:38:39,591 --> 00:38:41,427
He makes all the decisions.

625
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,178
So Gyeong-jun takes after me.

626
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:45,723
And Hye-jun takes after Yeong-nam?

627
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:46,890
-No.
-No.

628
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:49,643
Don't you want me to resemble you?

629
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,520
And you? Don't you want to resemble me?

630
00:38:51,603 --> 00:38:53,022
You're overreacting, Dad.

631
00:38:53,105 --> 00:38:55,065
You should have happily accepted it.

632
00:38:55,149 --> 00:38:56,567
He has the most power here.

633
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,485
Why would you…

634
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,904
I don't have the most power.
Grandpa is right here.

635
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:03,949
Hey, all power derives from money.

636
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,245
Where are you going?

637
00:39:08,328 --> 00:39:10,247
-It's over.
-Dad.

638
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,082
You'd want me to resemble you, right?

639
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,876
What good will come from that?

640
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,128
You should take after your mother.

641
00:39:32,811 --> 00:39:35,230
You completely spoiled the mood.

642
00:39:35,314 --> 00:39:38,734
I know you didn't mean it, but it's nice.
They should take after me?

643
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:40,444
I meant it.

644
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:44,031
Hye-jun doesn't take after me.

645
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:45,574
He takes after you and Father.

646
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,077
He resembles you a lot in many ways.

647
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,203
Stop it.

648
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:54,666
Things worked out for him
because he doesn't take after me.

649
00:39:56,668 --> 00:40:00,214
I want him to continue living
a happy life just like Father.

650
00:40:06,512 --> 00:40:08,138
You don't hate Dad, right?

651
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:10,766
Why would I hate him?

652
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:13,727
Dad did everything he could to raise us.

653
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:14,853
"Us"?

654
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:16,355
No.

655
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,943
I didn't always enjoy being his favorite.

656
00:40:21,026 --> 00:40:22,402
At times, I was jealous of you

657
00:40:23,112 --> 00:40:24,238
because you had freedom.

658
00:40:26,573 --> 00:40:28,826
I guess you're right in a way.

659
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,287
But I do feel distant from Dad.

660
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,124
You're supposed to build intimacy.

661
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:37,751
You can't be close overnight
because you want to.

662
00:41:01,942 --> 00:41:05,237
LEE MIN-JAE

663
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:27,634
SUPERSTAR SA

664
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:31,555
<i>Let's discuss the contract next Friday.</i>

665
00:41:40,939 --> 00:41:42,232
You startled me.

666
00:41:42,316 --> 00:41:43,650
My gosh.

667
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:46,111
Why are you here at this hour?

668
00:41:46,195 --> 00:41:47,279
I forgot something.

669
00:41:47,362 --> 00:41:49,489
You could have picked it up tomorrow.

670
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,200
It will go bad.

671
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:53,827
Chi-yeong.

672
00:41:54,703 --> 00:41:58,957
Do you really not
want to be an actor again?

673
00:42:02,377 --> 00:42:03,378
No.

674
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:06,256
I don't want to give up on food,

675
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,633
and I hate memorizing lines.

676
00:42:08,508 --> 00:42:11,011
-Pick up Hye-jun tomorrow.
-He told me not to come.

677
00:42:11,678 --> 00:42:12,888
He's driving here.

678
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:14,348
He didn't renew it yet, right?

679
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,558
He goes to places alone a lot.

680
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:18,352
Ms. Lee, stay on your toes.

681
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,479
-Bye.
-Bye.

682
00:42:24,149 --> 00:42:26,235
I can still make a living
with what I've got.

683
00:42:35,577 --> 00:42:38,163
Sorry, am I too early?

684
00:42:39,164 --> 00:42:41,833
I'm Lee Jin-a.
Jin Seo-u recommended you to me.

685
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:44,878
Oh, it's fine. I should have come earlier.

686
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,421
Jin Seo-u is…

687
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:48,590
She was in <i>The First Human</i>.

688
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,927
Right. Come on in.

689
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:53,720
Thank you.

690
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,359
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

691
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:15,659
By the way,
why did Jin Seo-u recommend me?

692
00:43:17,286 --> 00:43:19,329
I heard Sa Hye-jun asked her to do it.

693
00:43:20,706 --> 00:43:22,749
Didn't you date him?

694
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:25,627
I think he called you his girlfriend.

695
00:43:27,296 --> 00:43:28,380
No, we didn't date.

696
00:43:29,256 --> 00:43:32,676
JJAMPPONG ENTERTAINMENT
LEE MIN-JAE, SA HYE-JUN

697
00:43:39,308 --> 00:43:42,561
I'll keep rooting for you even if
you don't want to renew the contract.

698
00:43:43,145 --> 00:43:44,521
-I want to enlist.
-What?

699
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:49,651
We can postpone it again.
You can enlist next year.

700
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:52,946
You're about to renew seven ad contracts.

701
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,699
Director Mark James said
he'll send you a script.

702
00:43:55,782 --> 00:43:57,451
You might debut in Hollywood next year.

703
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,202
Let's wrap things up.

704
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:02,956
I can't stop you, of course.

705
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:05,292
But why now?

706
00:44:07,085 --> 00:44:08,337
Because it's the soonest.

707
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,258
I've put my name on the map.

708
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:17,095
A two-year hiatus

709
00:44:18,805 --> 00:44:19,806
doesn't scare me.

710
00:44:22,184 --> 00:44:24,311
We'll talk again when you're discharged.

711
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:27,981
Min-jae.

712
00:44:30,192 --> 00:44:33,195
I've thought about it.
<i>Jjamppong</i> is better than <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

713
00:44:34,488 --> 00:44:35,614
What?

714
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:44,081
We'll renew it for three years
including my time in service.

715
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,635
No, 4 years. And a 30 to 70 split.

716
00:44:56,718 --> 00:44:58,512
-You take care of all expenses.
-Deal.

717
00:45:18,198 --> 00:45:20,117
Sir, why didn't you answer my calls?

718
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,994
I must've been in the elevator. What's up?

719
00:45:23,578 --> 00:45:24,996
Reporter Kim Su-man called.

720
00:45:25,497 --> 00:45:26,540
What's she saying now?

721
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:30,502
She wanted to ask about
the debt scandal surrounding Do-ha's dad.

722
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,338
She received many tips.

723
00:45:34,297 --> 00:45:37,008
Tell her to hold off on it
and not to write an article yet.

724
00:45:37,092 --> 00:45:38,468
Yes, sir.

725
00:45:39,678 --> 00:45:41,304
PARK DO-HA

726
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,724
Hi, Do-ha.

727
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,643
What is it that you even do?

728
00:45:46,726 --> 00:45:48,103
Did you see the article?

729
00:45:49,312 --> 00:45:50,647
The article is already out?

730
00:45:52,107 --> 00:45:54,109
Kim Su-man, that woman…

731
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:56,611
DEBT SCANDAL SURROUNDING
PARK DO-HA'S FATHER

732
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:06,997
You must be very satisfied
with the article you wrote.

733
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,501
It's been a while.

734
00:46:11,585 --> 00:46:14,045
I always read about what you're up to,

735
00:46:14,129 --> 00:46:16,298
so I feel as though I see you every day.

736
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:18,884
My articles grab people's attention,
don't they?

737
00:46:19,593 --> 00:46:20,677
You see, Do-ha…

738
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,180
I don't really care about him.

739
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,683
If he falls hard,
I can find another celebrity to manage.

740
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:28,894
But you picked the wrong target.

741
00:46:29,895 --> 00:46:32,022
I don't want Do-ha to suffer any damage.

742
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:34,941
You don't feel guilty
about letting others suffer.

743
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,277
But you're not like me.

744
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:40,405
Do you want to turn out like me?

745
00:46:52,626 --> 00:46:55,128
<i>We need to talk. Come to the library.</i>

746
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:56,630
<i>I'll read while I wait.</i>

747
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:50,558
-Let's get out of here.
-I want to read more.

748
00:47:52,644 --> 00:47:54,104
Sorry, I'll get going then.

749
00:48:01,903 --> 00:48:02,988
Did something happen?

750
00:48:04,906 --> 00:48:05,907
No.

751
00:48:07,742 --> 00:48:09,536
Then why are you going home suddenly?

752
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:11,955
I'm sorry.

753
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,542
You said you had something to tell me.
What is it?

754
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:18,586
-Nothing important.
-What is it about?

755
00:48:20,088 --> 00:48:21,047
I'm enlisting.

756
00:48:22,007 --> 00:48:23,216
You already told me.

757
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,343
<i>I'm leaving tomorrow.</i>

758
00:48:25,844 --> 00:48:27,679
Right, I did.

759
00:48:27,762 --> 00:48:29,055
Jeez.

760
00:48:30,348 --> 00:48:32,100
The bus is here. Sorry.

761
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:11,306
<i>More than anything, it was possible
thanks to the viewers' support.</i>

762
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:12,974
<i>And all the staff and cast members</i>

763
00:49:13,058 --> 00:49:16,227
<i>did a great job,
so I think that's why it was possible.</i>

764
00:49:16,311 --> 00:49:20,607
<i>I see. Lastly, can you tell your fans
about the plans you have for the future?</i>

765
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,777
<i>Nothing has been decided yet.</i>

766
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,363
<i>I'm just doing my best
to enjoy the present moment.</i>

767
00:49:26,446 --> 00:49:29,449
<i>Thank you for watching our interview
with Sa Hye-jun.</i>

768
00:50:10,365 --> 00:50:11,491
They're comfy.

769
00:50:52,574 --> 00:50:54,367
You have to go to Pohang for a shoot?

770
00:50:56,744 --> 00:50:59,164
-I'll tell you about it tomorrow.
-Okay.

771
00:51:08,756 --> 00:51:10,717
-Mom.
-Yes?

772
00:51:22,896 --> 00:51:24,314
All right.

773
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:27,734
I've decided to focus on the fact
that you're a wonderful person.

774
00:51:30,278 --> 00:51:31,905
I love you.

775
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,031
I love you too.

776
00:52:06,648 --> 00:52:08,191
<i>I'm joining the Marine Corps.</i>

777
00:52:08,858 --> 00:52:10,401
<i>I'm at the barbershop now.</i>

778
00:52:13,696 --> 00:52:14,781
<i>This early?</i>

779
00:52:15,323 --> 00:52:16,658
<i>I'm beating you to it.</i>

780
00:52:17,617 --> 00:52:20,453
<i>Are you serious?
Why the heck are you doing this?</i>

781
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:22,080
<i>Do your parents know?</i>

782
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,040
<i>Your call will be directed to voicemail…</i>

783
00:52:24,123 --> 00:52:26,626
Why isn't he picking up?
Is he at the shoot?

784
00:52:32,674 --> 00:52:35,927
<i>He's so neat.
He organized his room before he went out.</i>

785
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:40,014
<i>"To Mom"?</i>

786
00:52:42,475 --> 00:52:43,643
<i>It's for me.</i>

787
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,233
<i>Mom.</i>

788
00:52:52,527 --> 00:52:55,780
<i>You helped me realize I was arrogant
to think I could succeed on my own.</i>

789
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,160
<i>I've now accepted that my background</i>

790
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:03,746
<i>is also one of my strengths.</i>

791
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:08,793
<i>Enlisting was my own decision.</i>

792
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:11,087
<i>I'm joining the Marine Corps.</i>

793
00:53:13,923 --> 00:53:15,049
<i>Take care.</i>

794
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:19,679
<i>From your son, Hae-hyo.</i>

795
00:53:56,924 --> 00:53:58,801
-Hi.
-Hi.

796
00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:01,387
What are you doing?

797
00:54:01,888 --> 00:54:04,599
Getting together some stuff to give you
before I enlist.

798
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,311
Nice, this is from a designer brand.

799
00:54:08,394 --> 00:54:10,229
Wear it on your grand opening day.

800
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:13,066
Thanks, friend.

801
00:54:13,816 --> 00:54:14,817
That's not everything.

802
00:54:15,693 --> 00:54:17,195
What? There's more?

803
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:22,659
Buy equipment for your studio.

804
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,833
Hye-jun!

805
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:33,711
You're so thoughtful.

806
00:54:33,795 --> 00:54:36,506
Cash is the best kind of gift.

807
00:54:38,216 --> 00:54:39,634
Are your parents here yet?

808
00:54:39,717 --> 00:54:42,387
I wish he had already done it.

809
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,806
He should've just gotten it over with.

810
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:46,724
He didn't listen when I suggested it.

811
00:54:46,808 --> 00:54:49,352
-Why enlist now?
-Well, he'll be fine.

812
00:54:49,435 --> 00:54:52,271
I think 21 is the perfect age.

813
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:56,025
Hye-jun, you look radiant.
You're brightening up the whole room.

814
00:54:57,276 --> 00:54:58,695
I wish my mom was here.

815
00:54:58,778 --> 00:55:00,988
If she was here, she'd be all over him,

816
00:55:01,072 --> 00:55:03,032
pestering him to take pictures with her.

817
00:55:04,117 --> 00:55:05,827
Father, say a few words.

818
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:08,246
What's there to say?

819
00:55:08,329 --> 00:55:10,039
I'm just happy that everyone's here.

820
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:11,999
Your stature has improved significantly.

821
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,419
Did you have to say that
right at this moment?

822
00:55:15,086 --> 00:55:18,339
It's okay. It's true.

823
00:55:18,423 --> 00:55:20,508
Oh, Mr. Sa. How's your shoulder?

824
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:23,761
My shoulder?

825
00:55:24,971 --> 00:55:28,099
My shoulders are totally fine.

826
00:55:31,269 --> 00:55:33,479
I know that is not the case

827
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,481
and that you almost needed
another surgery.

828
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:37,525
-I know too.
-Me too.

829
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,778
Mr. Sa, we all know about it.

830
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,865
Hey, I told you not to tell anyone.

831
00:55:43,948 --> 00:55:46,075
Why didn't I know when everyone else knew?

832
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:47,618
All right, let's eat.

833
00:55:49,537 --> 00:55:51,497
Oh, Hye-jun. You should say a few words.

834
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:55,209
Once you enlist, we won't be able
to get together for a few years.

835
00:55:55,293 --> 00:55:56,961
Hey, he can go on leave.

836
00:55:57,044 --> 00:55:59,422
Don't you know?
I already served in the army.

837
00:55:59,505 --> 00:56:01,090
I wanted to hear his voice.

838
00:56:01,174 --> 00:56:03,342
These days,
you can even use your cell phone.

839
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,095
-It's paradise compared to the old days.
-Totally.

840
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:08,848
-We were cut off from the outside world.
-That's right.

841
00:56:08,931 --> 00:56:11,392
Hey. We also have lots to say
about this topic.

842
00:56:11,476 --> 00:56:14,020
That's right!
We had to serve for 30 months,

843
00:56:14,103 --> 00:56:15,396
but it's only 18 months now.

844
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,815
Dad, I had to serve for 21 months.

845
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:30,578
I WILL START A LIVE VIDEO
AT 10 P.M. ON SEPTEMBER 7

846
00:56:30,661 --> 00:56:34,499
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SAY
TO ALL MY FANS. PLEASE JOIN ME

847
00:56:51,724 --> 00:56:53,184
<i>I should just enlist too.</i>

848
00:56:54,143 --> 00:56:56,479
Or maybe I should stop working with you.

849
00:56:58,022 --> 00:57:00,316
You and Reporter Kim Su-man
used to be close.

850
00:57:01,067 --> 00:57:02,443
But she's attacking you now.

851
00:57:02,527 --> 00:57:06,197
She's attacking you, not me.

852
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,117
Because she's jealous of you.

853
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,743
Why is a reporter jealous of me?

854
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,245
Because you're successful.

855
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,920
People refuse to give me credit
for my hard work.

856
00:57:22,046 --> 00:57:23,464
They think I made no effort.

857
00:57:23,548 --> 00:57:26,050
My dad put me through hell.

858
00:57:26,134 --> 00:57:28,678
Now, people are trying
to take me down using my dad.

859
00:57:29,303 --> 00:57:31,931
It's all because you're too handsome.

860
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,643
People only give value to things
that were gained through effort.

861
00:57:35,726 --> 00:57:38,437
You didn't have to work
for your good looks.

862
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,899
Some things can't be obtained
no matter how hard you work.

863
00:57:43,109 --> 00:57:45,111
Well, that is true.

864
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:49,490
Even plastic surgery
won't give you this face.

865
00:57:49,574 --> 00:57:50,741
Exactly.

866
00:57:53,161 --> 00:57:55,830
We'll postpone your enlistment
for as long as we can.

867
00:57:56,622 --> 00:57:59,208
The world will be your oyster
once Hye-jun joins the army.

868
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:01,460
And when he comes back,

869
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:03,337
his young, fresh charm will be gone.

870
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:07,633
You'll enlist
when you're about to lose such charm,

871
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:08,843
so you'll be fine.

872
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:15,743
I'm sorry.

873
00:59:16,285 --> 00:59:18,788
Can I get your autograph?

874
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:23,918
Why are you sorry?

875
00:59:24,001 --> 00:59:27,505
I don't want to interrupt your alone time,

876
00:59:28,214 --> 00:59:31,342
but my grandkid is a huge fan of yours.

877
00:59:32,134 --> 00:59:34,762
I want to make him happy.

878
00:59:35,388 --> 00:59:36,389
I'm sorry.

879
00:59:38,224 --> 00:59:40,142
What's your grandson's name?

880
00:59:40,226 --> 00:59:41,394
Kim Him-chan.

881
00:59:51,445 --> 00:59:52,363
Thank you.

01:00:54,842 --> 01:00:56,719
Hello. It's me, Sa Hye-jun.

885
01:00:59,138 --> 01:01:00,431
This is my room.

886
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:04,352
Growing up, what I wanted the most
was my own room.

887
01:01:06,103 --> 01:01:08,856
And that wish finally came true
a little while ago.

888
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:12,360
<i>Now that I have my own room,</i>

889
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:16,113
<i>I have more time
to have a conversation with myself.</i>

890
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:23,579
<i>I thought about who I'm most grateful to.</i>

891
01:01:28,709 --> 01:01:29,919
It's you guys.

892
01:01:31,045 --> 01:01:33,798
Thanks to your love and support,

893
01:01:34,465 --> 01:01:37,885
I've come to appreciate
what society can do for us humans.

894
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:42,515
I am joining the army
to complete my military service.

895
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:45,935
I promise you I'll come back
in good health.

896
01:01:50,564 --> 01:01:52,191
REALLY?

897
01:01:52,274 --> 01:01:53,901
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

898
01:01:53,984 --> 01:01:55,611
DON'T GO

2 YEARS LATER

01:02:04,264 --> 01:02:06,224
Can you organize the client list again?

901
01:02:06,892 --> 01:02:10,270
I'm on my way to the broadcasting station.
I'll be back by five.

DIRECTOR LEE HYEOK

905
01:02:17,736 --> 01:02:19,446
Su-bin, the director is calling.

906
01:02:20,405 --> 01:02:21,406
Okay.

907
01:02:23,325 --> 01:02:24,784
Hello, An Jeong-ha speaking.

908
01:02:26,411 --> 01:02:27,662
An outdoor shoot?

909
01:02:28,747 --> 01:02:29,748
Sure, no problem.

910
01:02:34,711 --> 01:02:38,131
-We have to get there before they do.
-Don't worry. We're 30 minutes early.

911
01:02:39,007 --> 01:02:40,967
-Are you that excited?
-Yes, I'm thrilled!

912
01:02:41,051 --> 01:02:43,887
I've always wanted to work
with the writer of <i>I'm Sorry, I Love You</i>.

913
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,180
It's finally happening.

914
01:02:45,263 --> 01:02:48,350
Don't be too chatty.
I have to attend Grandpa's award ceremony.

915
01:02:48,433 --> 01:02:51,269
I've already told them
that we have to leave in an hour.

916
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:54,648
You're very good at your job. I approve.

917
01:02:56,775 --> 01:02:57,984
All right, let's go in.

THE 15TH RESTART ACADEMY AWARDS

919
01:03:04,866 --> 01:03:09,246
The Restart Academy Award Ceremony
has a long history.

920
01:03:09,329 --> 01:03:11,456
We will now present the Achievement Award.

921
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,166
-Are you nervous?
-He worked tirelessly

922
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,167
-I'm fine.
-across many different fields.

923
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:15,460
Do you want some water?

924
01:03:15,544 --> 01:03:18,171
-No, I can't go to the washroom.
-I am honored to have worked with him

925
01:03:18,255 --> 01:03:21,216
-I'm here.
-over all those years.

926
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:24,761
We chose him as the winner of this award

927
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:27,597
especially because the advertisers
love him very much.

928
01:03:27,681 --> 01:03:30,850
The winner is Mr. Sa Min-gi.

929
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:46,575
He's our oldest model.

930
01:03:47,284 --> 01:03:49,619
Please give him
another big round of applause.

931
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,543
Thank you.

932
01:03:57,544 --> 01:03:59,713
I wasted

933
01:04:00,964 --> 01:04:02,382
a big portion of my life.

934
01:04:03,758 --> 01:04:08,054
But I was lucky enough to have my son.

935
01:04:09,306 --> 01:04:13,268
My son had to put up with a lot
because of me.

936
01:04:13,977 --> 01:04:16,771
Yeong-nam, if I ever won the lottery,

937
01:04:18,273 --> 01:04:20,900
I was going to give you all the money,

938
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:23,278
but it hasn't happened yet.

939
01:04:30,035 --> 01:04:33,913
I now know
that I shouldn't waste my life away.

940
01:04:34,914 --> 01:04:38,543
I plan to live each day to the fullest
so that I can repay my son

941
01:04:40,128 --> 01:04:43,882
for all the trouble I put him through.

942
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:49,346
I'm not sure if I can fully repay him
before I die,

943
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:52,098
but I'll do

944
01:04:53,266 --> 01:04:54,392
my very best.

945
01:04:56,144 --> 01:04:57,187
ACHIEVEMENT AWARD

946
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,355
I dedicate this award

947
01:05:00,565 --> 01:05:02,484
to my son,

948
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:07,697
Yeong-nam.

949
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:51,950
Stop crying.

950
01:05:55,203 --> 01:05:56,663
I didn't even cry that much.

951
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:59,332
You've been crying
since the award ceremony.

952
01:05:59,416 --> 01:06:01,292
It makes you look like a terrible son.

953
01:06:02,627 --> 01:06:05,880
You've been very good to Father lately.

954
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:08,049
What's Hye-jun doing?

955
01:06:09,259 --> 01:06:10,552
Hye-jun? Why?

956
01:06:26,901 --> 01:06:28,111
I have something to say.

957
01:06:29,821 --> 01:06:30,697
What is it?

958
01:06:34,117 --> 01:06:35,285
I'm sorry.

959
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:41,875
I regret it very much.

960
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:47,464
I wasn't there for you
when you were going through

961
01:06:48,631 --> 01:06:49,799
a rough patch.

962
01:07:10,195 --> 01:07:11,654
It's all in the past now.

963
01:07:13,198 --> 01:07:14,324
It was

964
01:07:17,494 --> 01:07:18,912
because of my insecurities.

965
01:07:21,331 --> 01:07:22,749
What I regret the most

966
01:07:24,042 --> 01:07:25,335
is hitting you.

967
01:07:27,295 --> 01:07:28,838
It wasn't because I hated you.

968
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:31,382
I wanted to support you

969
01:07:32,926 --> 01:07:34,385
but didn't have the means to.

970
01:07:35,386 --> 01:07:36,596
I was so angry at myself

971
01:07:37,555 --> 01:07:38,765
that I couldn't take it.

972
01:07:42,977 --> 01:07:44,020
Because you are

973
01:07:44,938 --> 01:07:48,233
so perfect and competent,
I felt that there was nothing

974
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:51,194
I could do for you.

975
01:07:53,613 --> 01:07:54,864
I was scared.

976
01:08:01,996 --> 01:08:03,081
I'm sorry too.

977
01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:05,583
Why are you sorry?

978
01:08:06,709 --> 01:08:08,086
You never did anything wrong.

979
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,713
Since graduating from high school,

980
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:14,092
you've been financially independent.

981
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:20,932
I resented you a lot.

982
01:08:21,015 --> 01:08:23,518
That's okay. You can resent me.

983
01:08:24,853 --> 01:08:27,564
It's my own fault. Don't be sorry.

984
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,068
I know

985
01:08:34,237 --> 01:08:35,738
that you did it for my own sake.

986
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:39,075
Then it's all good.

987
01:08:41,786 --> 01:08:43,371
I really care about you a lot.

988
01:08:45,498 --> 01:08:46,875
I'm just not good with words.

989
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,675
All the resentment is gone now.

990
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:00,722
I'm at peace
now that I know you approve of me.

991
01:09:06,644 --> 01:09:08,980
I always wanted your approval.

992
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:15,278
Shall I give you a hug?

993
01:09:15,361 --> 01:09:17,530
-No, thanks.
-Right, not a good idea.

994
01:09:36,466 --> 01:09:37,634
<i>In your 20s,</i>

995
01:09:38,551 --> 01:09:41,721
<i>you learn to detach yourself
from your parents' influence.</i>

996
01:09:48,019 --> 01:09:49,312
Are you going out?

997
01:09:51,022 --> 01:09:52,315
I'm seeing my friends.

998
01:09:53,191 --> 01:09:55,526
You guys haven't changed at all.

999
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:57,028
Jealous?

1000
01:09:57,862 --> 01:09:59,447
-Get going.
-Bye.

1001
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,416
<i>Now, we're entering our 30s.</i>

1002
01:10:12,377 --> 01:10:15,088
<i>The age at which you can no longer
blame others.</i>

1003
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,853
Look at you sitting so quietly.

1004
01:10:30,937 --> 01:10:31,980
Is that your seat?

1005
01:10:32,605 --> 01:10:34,107
No, sir. You can sit.

1006
01:10:35,358 --> 01:10:37,443
-What's with you?
-I'm just being nice.

1007
01:10:37,527 --> 01:10:38,695
Why are you being nice?

1008
01:10:40,321 --> 01:10:41,531
Can I

1009
01:10:42,532 --> 01:10:44,450
do a photo shoot with you at my studio?

1010
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,704
-You can.
-Seriously?

1011
01:10:47,787 --> 01:10:49,706
-Yes.
-I didn't think it'd be this easy.

1012
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:51,582
It's just a photo shoot.

1013
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:54,419
Right? Why was it so hard for you
to bring it up?

1014
01:10:54,502 --> 01:10:55,628
I'll do it too.

1015
01:10:56,462 --> 01:10:58,256
What? You guys are nuts.

1016
01:10:58,339 --> 01:11:00,299
Are you sure? You're both very expensive.

1017
01:11:00,383 --> 01:11:02,468
-Is he losing his mind?
-Maybe.

1018
01:11:02,552 --> 01:11:04,137
We should be paying you.

1019
01:11:06,389 --> 01:11:07,348
Oh, you're right.

1020
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:10,143
Your hair has grown a lot.

1021
01:11:11,352 --> 01:11:13,896
Hey, I was discharged
shortly after you were.

1022
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,982
He always wants to emphasize
he went first.

1023
01:11:16,065 --> 01:11:17,400
Yes, I do.

1024
01:11:17,984 --> 01:11:19,402
Do you want to see my abs?

1025
01:11:19,485 --> 01:11:21,404
-No!
-No, what are you doing?

1026
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:22,947
The training's got me ripped.

1027
01:11:23,031 --> 01:11:24,240
-Go away!
-I'll show you.

1028
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:25,450
-Are you crazy?
-Don't.

1029
01:11:25,533 --> 01:11:26,743
You should train with me.

1030
01:11:26,826 --> 01:11:28,578
I can't. I'm shooting a romance drama.

1031
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:30,538
-So you need a hot body.
-I have my eyes.

1032
01:11:30,621 --> 01:11:31,873
-What the…
-I'll show you.

1033
01:11:31,956 --> 01:11:33,541
-Show me what?
-Look!

1034
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:34,876
-Goodness.
-One!

1035
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:36,294
-Two!
-Two!

1036
01:11:36,377 --> 01:11:37,587
-That's it?
-You're done?

1037
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:39,172
-Is that it?
-Just two a day.

1038
01:11:39,255 --> 01:11:40,089
You were bluffing.

1039
01:11:40,173 --> 01:11:42,050
-That's more than enough.
-Hey, Jin-u.

1040
01:11:56,189 --> 01:11:58,191
<i>LOVE COMES WITH THE RAIN</i>

1041
01:12:32,183 --> 01:12:34,143
Looks like there's another shoot.

1042
01:12:34,227 --> 01:12:36,270
Let's have a look
before the director gets here.

1043
01:12:36,354 --> 01:12:37,230
Sure.

1044
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:03,923
Hello.

1045
01:13:06,092 --> 01:13:07,135
It's been a long time.

1046
01:13:19,063 --> 01:13:20,189
Those shoes.

1047
01:13:22,275 --> 01:13:23,734
They're so comfortable.

1048
01:13:24,819 --> 01:13:28,364
Are you going to tell me not to wear them
because we broke up?

1049
01:13:29,365 --> 01:13:30,533
I won't, of course.

1050
01:13:31,033 --> 01:13:33,077
I hope you don't think
I'm still not over you.

1051
01:13:33,161 --> 01:13:36,622
Do you think I'm wearing these shoes
because I'm still hung up on you?

1052
01:13:37,248 --> 01:13:39,750
You think and talk a lot
in such a short amount of time.

1053
01:13:41,961 --> 01:13:43,337
You don't like it?

1054
01:13:44,589 --> 01:13:45,631
I don't dislike it.

1055
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,139
When were you discharged?

1056
01:13:53,806 --> 01:13:55,266
Didn't you know I was back?

1057
01:13:55,349 --> 01:13:57,185
I'm sure it was all over the media.

1058
01:13:57,268 --> 01:14:00,354
My work keeps me very busy,
so I don't have time to watch TV.

1059
01:14:00,438 --> 01:14:02,607
-You always know what to say.
-I sure do.

1060
01:14:03,608 --> 01:14:05,610
You still have to win all the time.

1061
01:14:05,693 --> 01:14:08,237
I'll keep losing if I lose once,
so I'd rather win.

1062
01:14:08,321 --> 01:14:10,323
You obviously win all the time.

1063
01:14:10,406 --> 01:14:11,991
No, I lose all the time.

1064
01:14:14,118 --> 01:14:16,454
It's been so long. How have you been?

1065
01:14:17,622 --> 01:14:18,998
The same, you know.

1066
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:20,791
How's your studio doing?

1067
01:14:20,875 --> 01:14:23,377
It's doing pretty well.

1068
01:14:23,461 --> 01:14:26,130
-Do you have many celebrity clients?
-Do you want to come?

1069
01:14:27,089 --> 01:14:28,090
I'm going to say no.

1070
01:14:28,191 --> 01:14:30,696
