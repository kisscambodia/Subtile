HYE-JUN

6
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:55,452
Then we'll have less time to talk.
I have a client.

7
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:58,913
-I'll get straight to the point, then.
-Yes, I'd like that.

8
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,709
By the way, your makeup is excellent.

9
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:07,046
I didn't even do much today.

10
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,090
And you look this good?

11
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:11,634
Then with a little more makeup,
you'll look stunning.

12
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:13,219
Of course, you're already pretty.

13
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:18,308
Thank you.

14
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:22,854
Peach eyeshadow will look lovely on you.

15
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:26,066
Today won't work, but come and
get your makeup done some other day.

16
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:28,526
Are you trying to make me your client?

17
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,779
Come. I'll give you
a ten-percent discount.

18
00:01:31,446 --> 00:01:34,032
How long have you and Hye-jun been dating?

19
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:35,408
We're not dating.

20
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:38,244
We have photos of him leaving your place.

21
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:43,083
Is this an official interview?

22
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:45,835
Yes, it is.

23
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,129
Then you'd have to record
this conversation,

24
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:50,590
so I'll do it for you.

25
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:53,510
We shouldn't go back on what we said
here today, right?

26
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,726
Sa Hye-jun is one of my celebrity clients.

27
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,562
But we're the same age,

28
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:06,940
so I admit that he often treats me
like a friend.

GYEONG-JUN

36
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:44,185
-Hello, Gyeong-jun.
-Hello, Ms. Lee.

37
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:46,062
Couldn't you prevent this article?

38
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:48,773
I denied it,
but they went ahead and published it.

39
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:51,818
Okay, but it's your job to sort this out.

40
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:54,279
All right, I will get on it.

41
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:57,365
<i>-I have so much to do--</i>
-I wrote the letter.

42
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,201
Really?

43
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:04,205
I wrote it thinking that
I was apologizing to myself.

44
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:06,249
I wronged myself on so many occasions.

45
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:08,960
-What's he saying?
-What? Pardon?

46
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:12,380
Nothing. I'll pass it along to the lawyer.

47
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:14,674
All right.

48
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:19,596
Gosh, he's like
an overbearing mother-in-law.

49
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:24,767

51
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:33,610
What now?

52
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:41,659
Yes.

53
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,536
I saw the article about Hye-jun.

54
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,330
Why hasn't there been a rebuttal yet?

55
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:48,082
Gosh, seriously. Mind your own business.

56
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,210
This is my business.
I'll sign with Hye-jun.

57
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:53,755
Take good care of him
until he signs with me.

58
00:03:56,382 --> 00:04:00,011
You must think I'm a joke for you
to tell me that you'll steal him from me.

59
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:03,806
You have to keep saying it aloud
to make it happen

60
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,267
even though
it seems practically impossible.

61
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:07,977
Hurry up and release a rebuttal.

62
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:10,438
The sooner you do it,
the better it will be for you.

63
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,066
I have to ask Hye-jun.

64
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:15,818
If you ask him,
he'll say he'll just go public with it.

65
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:16,986
You know very well.

66
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,406
Ms. Kim said she's working on a story
that's even more scandalous.

67
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,866
Don't think this will be easy.

68
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:26,371
CONFESSION

69
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:28,164
<i>Is it about my boyfriend?</i>

70
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:30,959
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

71
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,461
You were going to confess
that you're his girlfriend

72
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:37,340
but you couldn't
because Jung Ji-a beat you to it.

73
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:41,552
I just wanted to thank my subscribers.

74
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:44,722
I'm on your side, Jeong-ha.

75
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:47,809
Sa Hye-jun has changed
since he blew up, didn't he?

76
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:49,686
I mean, his status has changed.

77
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,564
Hye-jun isn't like that.

78
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:57,944
Why are you so protective of him?

79
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:01,281
Why are you trying to turn me
into a woman who was dumped?

80
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,284
When I interviewed Jung Ji-a,

81
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:07,578
I could tell that
she still wasn't over him.

82
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:12,000
She agreed to reveal her name and face
because she still loves him very much.

83
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:15,586
Those two are on the same level now.

84
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:19,424
Everyone around them will be happy
if they get back together.

85
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:25,805
I see that you're a skilled interviewer.

86
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,642
I am definitely offended,

87
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:32,353
and you're making me want
to say bad stuff about Hye-jun.

88
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,939
Next time, book an appointment first.

89
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:38,109
I can help you improve
your public image as well.

90
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,035
HYE-JUN

91
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:49,162
-Hey.
-What are you up to?

92
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:50,830
<i>Going to my Pilates class.</i>

93
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:52,373
<i>Aren't you seeing Jeong-ha?</i>

94
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:55,877
We couldn't meet up,
so I was wondering if you were free.

95
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,420
Am I her stand-in?

96
00:05:57,503 --> 00:05:59,255
Do you think you can be her stand-in?

97
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:01,132
<i>Cut it out, will you?</i>

98
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,343
SA HYE-JUN DENIES DATING RUMORS

99
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:19,609
You come here too?
I guess you really are a hotshot now.

100
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:21,277
You haven't changed at all.

101
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,696
So this is still your indicator
for judging success.

102
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,073
Yes, I'm still the same.

103
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:28,242
Do you think you're any different?

104
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:32,163
I never claimed to be.

105
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,169
Do you remember when we first met?

106
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:41,589
You were such a show-off that I thought
you were different from me.

107
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:44,175
I bet you can relate to me now.

108
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:50,807
you had that article published in no time,
denying your relationship with Jeong-ha.

109
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:53,184
An article?

110
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:56,437
Of course.

111
00:06:56,521 --> 00:06:59,649
You should say that your manager did it
without telling you.

112
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,152
You're a fast learner, Hye-jun.

113
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:26,175
-You didn't get changed.
-I have to go to JJamppong.

114
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,552
Isn't it your day off?

115
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:29,887
Didn't you see the article?

116
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,472
Must I bring it up?

117
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,975
I have nothing to say about it.

118
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:37,145
-What did Jeong-ha say?
-I can't reach her.

119
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:39,772
Did you release that without telling her?

120
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:42,275
I have to find that out,
but Min-jae isn't picking up.

121
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:48,573
I stopped by to say hello
because it's been a while.

122
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:51,993
I'm so anxious these days.

123
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:55,705
What will the management say?
They've been quiet so far.

124
00:07:56,664 --> 00:07:59,167
His quick rise to stardom

125
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,795
has caused a lot of jealousy and rumors.

126
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,797
There are too many dating rumors

127
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:07,300
and too many scandalous gossip.

128
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:10,344
We signed with him because of
his upright image.

129
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:12,638
Please, handle the media better.

130
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:16,017
I'm worried that
all these scathing articles about him

131
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,769
would damage the company's public image.

132
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:20,688
That won't happen.

133
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:23,065
We sued them for defamation.

134
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:35,703
Hi.

135
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:37,955
Hi, my foot.

136
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:41,292
I'm not in the mood to say hi to you.

137
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:44,879
I guess you don't want to lose
the advertisements.

138
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:48,174
I see that you've turned
into a total money-grubber.

139
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,551
Good. You're a true manager now.

140
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:53,930
They trusted Hye-jun to be
the face of their brand,

141
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,933
so I didn't want to trouble them.
It's not about money.

142
00:08:58,267 --> 00:08:59,185
What brings you by?

143
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:02,188
If Hye-jun loses the contract,
Do-ha should get it.

144
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:04,273
Park Do-ha, a man of sound body and mind.

145
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,526
Are you deliberately trying
to sabotage him?

146
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:09,987
Then why do you even want to
manage Hye-jun?

147
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:13,574
Because he's proven himself as a star.

148
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:16,953
And all the rumors about him are false.

149
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:19,372
His momentum can't be stopped.

150
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:22,041
I'm saying that I'll help him
get back up if he falls.

151
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:25,461
How very thoughtful.

152
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:28,839
I can hire you at our company too.
You can't do this alone.

153
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:31,384
Has he renewed his contract?

154
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:38,140
I guess he hasn't. See? I told you.

155
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:40,434
They all think it was all their doing.

156
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:42,353
Why do you think I ended up like this?

157
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:45,147
Trust, faith, love?

158
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:48,859
At the end of the day,
it's all bullshit if you have no money.

159
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:51,571
You keep believing that.
I'll go my own way.

160
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:54,115
Do you think
he'll recognize your hard work?

161
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:55,616
Does he know you're here?

162
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,119
I bet you released the rebuttal
without asking him.

163
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:01,455
Your relationship will be cracking soon.

164
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,457
What you're hoping for will not happen.

165
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,793
We're very tight.

166
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:08,379
Why did you release the article
without telling me?

167
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:10,423
A rebuttal has to be released quickly.

168
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:13,843
-The sooner the better.
-Fine.

169
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:16,012
Let's forget about what I think
for a second.

170
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:18,014
Did you give Jeong-ha the heads-up?

171
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,768
Jeong-ha will understand.
She's very clever.

172
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:25,605
I don't want her privacy
to be infringed upon because of me.

173
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:26,939
I know that.

174
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:31,319
But I need to do my job too.

175
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:34,614
As your manager,
my priority is to protect you.

176
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:41,495
I get what you're saying.

177
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,835
But to me,
protecting Jeong-ha comes first.

178
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:11,025
NEW COMMENT

179
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:17,031
WAKE UP.
TO HIM, YOU'RE JUST ONE OF THE GIRLS.

180
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:19,408
WHY MAKE A MOVE ON HIM
WHEN YOU SHOULD BE WORKING?

181
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:21,744
YOU NEED A REALITY CHECK

182
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:25,039
YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM

183
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:33,255
MOM

184
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:56,320
Hey, Hae-hyo.

185
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:59,198
I saw Hye-jun.
He said he couldn't reach you.

186
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,327
-I'm going to call him.
-<i>Where are you now?</i>

187
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,415
-Home.
-<i>Why are you home already?</i>

188
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:09,750
My mom's coming.

189
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:15,047
You answered my call.
Why didn't you pick up Hye-jun's?

190
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:19,009
-You're asking that now?
-<i>You shouldn't have picked up.</i>

191
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:22,096
Then I would've come over, all worried.

192
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,602
-You're a great friend.
-<i>Did you just realize that?</i>

193
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:37,653
<i>Why do people apologize to each other
when they're in love?</i>

194
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:44,535
Maybe because
they want to do better but can't.

195
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:47,163
They can try and be better. Why apologize?

196
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:53,377
I'll never apologize for that reason.

197
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:04,180
HYE-JUN

198
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:08,767
<i>"I'll never say sorry."</i>

199
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:14,773
<i>He couldn't keep his word.</i>

200
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:28,579
<i>Back then, we thought love was simple.</i>

201
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:35,169
<i>Love encompasses all sorts of emotions.</i>

202
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:25,219
The First Human <i>is about a feud between
third-generation conglomerate heirs</i>

203
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:27,555
<i>over their family business
and also about romance.</i>

204
00:14:27,638 --> 00:14:30,808
-<i>You've done a number of romance dramas.</i>
-He sounds so natural.

205
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:33,894
-<i>This made me curious about you</i>
-So different from when he's home.

206
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:37,064
-<i>and your co-star, Jin Seo-u.</i>
-That's why he made it.

207
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:38,691
-<i>The shoot hasn't begun yet,</i>
-What?

208
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:42,069
-<i>but Seo-u and I have been friends…</i>
-He's made it big.

209
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:44,363
Yes. It's good to see you
finally admitting it.

210
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:47,533
What's going on with the lawsuits?

211
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:50,286
I wanted to ask him earlier.

212
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:52,580
Ms. Lee will tell us
when it's all sorted out.

213
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:56,709
Like Gyeong-jun said, I wouldn't
be worried if it was a big agency.

214
00:14:57,835 --> 00:14:59,128
Will she be able to manage?

215
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,589
I'm worried too.

216
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:05,467
Father! Where are you going?

217
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:08,762
I have a meeting at the academy.

218
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:11,140
-Honey, get going.
-What do you mean?

219
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:13,517
-Father's heading out.
-So what?

220
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:15,728
Come on. Give him a ride.

221
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,980
Are you going to take his side?

222
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:24,653
The business is slow, I guess?

223
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:28,157
I think Yeong-nam is stressed,
although he's trying to hide it.

224
00:15:32,786 --> 00:15:33,829
I'll just say it!

225
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:39,209
It's not that. He was told
he shouldn't use his shoulders.

226
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,962
Jang-man's been working
without him for a while.

227
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:48,761
Father is getting old, you know.
You'll regret this later on.

228
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:51,555
If my parents were still alive,
I'd be so good to them.

229
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,474
You still have a chance.

230
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,977
What if he keeps expecting me
to be his driver?

231
00:15:57,061 --> 00:15:59,939
-I'm fine with that.
-I need to continue my work.

232
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:01,649
It's okay. I'm working.

233
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:04,485
I make enough
to cover our living expenses.

234
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:06,570
Hurry up. I'll be late.

235
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:09,073
Gosh.

236
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:21,877
-Here.
-Thank you.

237
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:29,551
It looks like your son
really is your manager now.

238
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:32,012
What about your work?

239
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:34,974
I'll figure that out.
Why did you want to see my father today?

240
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:38,644
So you're not actually his manager, right?

241
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:43,857
This isn't about work.
We'd like an exclusive contract with you.

242
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:51,991
An exclusive contract?
What does that entail?

243
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:54,076
You'll only work with us.

244
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,578
But we'll take great care of you.

245
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:59,748
He already gets work through you guys.
What's different?

246
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,543
Here's the contract.

247
00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:05,671
You read it over.

248
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,802
The most important part is
that it'll be a 60-40 split.

249
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:14,304
We'll give him all the support he needs.

250
00:17:14,805 --> 00:17:18,308
You no longer need to neglect your job
and follow Mr. Sa around.

251
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:21,562
What will happen
if I don't sign this contract?

252
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:25,649
Then we'll just keep doing
what we're doing now.

253
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:29,403
I'll just do that, then.
I want to keep my son as my manager.

254
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:33,782
You can't compare our management
to the work your son's doing for you.

255
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,827
-We're professionals.
-I feel more comfortable with my son.

256
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,662
Let's go. Call me if there's work.

257
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,832
Why aren't you saying anything?

258
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:45,335
Why would I interrupt
when my father's talking?

259
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,921
Hey, I'm surprised
you can say stuff like that.

260
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:48,964
Stuff like what?

261
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:51,508
You're talking like an obedient son.

262
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,552
I'm going to try from now on.

263
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:55,971
-Should I stop?
-It's not that.

264
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:57,848
It's just scary because it's so sudden.

265
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:00,768
You scared me the other day too.

266
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:03,562
Gosh! There you go again.
Okay, fine. I heard you.

267
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:06,273
-Be quiet, please.
-Well said. Be quiet.

268
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:11,612
-Can we listen to some music?
-Sure.

269
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:13,947
Can you put it on for me?

270
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,242
Jeez.

271
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:26,436
HYE-JUN

272
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:34,862
Hey, Hye-jun.

273
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:37,322
"Hey, Hye-jun"?

274
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,783
I was worried but you sound cheerful.

275
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:42,911
-<i>Is this intentional?</i>
-You sound aggressive.

276
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:44,621
I'm sorry I stood you up.

277
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,918
-Where are you?
-<i>Home.</i>

278
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:53,046
Should I come over?

279
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:59,803
That's my mom. Talk about bad timing.

280
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:03,974
Right, you said your mom was coming.

281
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:08,604
Today's just not my day, it seems.

282
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:13,025
Right.

283
00:20:15,944 --> 00:20:17,196
Go get the door.

284
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:22,826
I'm coming.

285
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:31,835
What is this?

286
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:35,631
What do you think?
I'm going to stay with you for a few days.

287
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:41,887
Tell everyone food is ready.

288
00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:44,723
I took the day off today.

289
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:47,226
I'm supposed to be resting,

290
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:50,145
but I keep setting the table.

291
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:53,190
You have to set the table to eat.

292
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:55,567
You've had it too easy until now.

293
00:20:55,651 --> 00:20:57,444
The table is set. What's Hye-jun doing?

294
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:01,240
Can't you even come and eat?

295
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:58,082
Where is this soybean paste from?
It's not store-bought.

296
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,375
Dad sent it to me.

297
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:06,841
So this is how he got you?

298
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,345
What are you talking about? He's my dad.

299
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,807
I went through so much to raise you,

300
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:17,810
but you seem to care more about your dad.

301
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:20,938
What's with that suitcase?

302
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:24,776
Let me stay for a few days.

303
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,116
By the way, he's a real catch.

304
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:34,702
What do you mean?

305
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,954
I was wondering why you quit your job
to work at a salon.

306
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:40,500
Was it because of Sa Hye-jun?

307
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:44,921
-What are you talking about?
-I read the article.

308
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:47,715
You really are my daughter.

309
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:51,719
I knew a smart girl like you wouldn't
quit your job without a solid plan.

310
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:54,389
-I misunderstood your intentions.
-Mom!

311
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:56,599
Da-on is a huge fan of his.

312
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:58,518
Can you get his autograph?

313
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:00,978
I'm sure he'll do it
for his girlfriend's brother.

314
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:07,151
I work with him,
so I can ask him for an autograph.

315
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:08,236
But I won't.

316
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,989
If I get you one,
your imagination will run wild.

317
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:20,957
It's so nice to have lunch and dinner
with all of you.

318
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,708
Only because it happens rarely.

319
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:25,420
You wouldn't want to cook
if this happened every day.

320
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:27,880
Why are you always so negative?

321
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:31,342
He just doesn't want his mom overworked.

322
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:33,261
Dad, you've finally come to your senses.

323
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:35,972
I am Sa Gyeong-jun! Your eldest son.

324
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:41,936
Tell Jeong-ha to come over for dinner
this weekend.

325
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,229
I'll cook something nice.

326
00:23:44,981 --> 00:23:46,274
Sounds good. I'll ask her.

327
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:49,610
Is it a good idea for her
to have dinner with us now?

328
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,321
-What do you mean?
-She--

329
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:53,865
Don't.

330
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:56,659
Okay.

331
00:24:01,122 --> 00:24:02,665
Does he have something on you?

332
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:05,418
It's so unlike you
to back down right away.

333
00:24:07,253 --> 00:24:09,422
I guess he's finally grown up.

334
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:13,843
There's a lot of growing up going on
in the family. That includes you, Father.

335
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,303
People don't change.

336
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:18,014
I was mature to begin with.
You just didn't know it.

337
00:24:18,514 --> 00:24:19,932
Thank you, Father.

338
00:24:20,641 --> 00:24:21,726
For what?

339
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:24,520
Thanks to you,
Yeong-nam is working as your agent.

340
00:24:24,604 --> 00:24:27,648
Gosh, you're overreacting.
He has no work at the moment anyway.

341
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,026
But I wonder if Dad
can actually work as an agent.

342
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:31,819
Why can't I?

343
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,197
An agent should know
what their client is thinking.

344
00:24:34,947 --> 00:24:37,992
You need to figure out what
your client needs and get it done.

345
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:41,162
I'm good at that.

346
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:42,121
-You?
-You?

347
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,502
I really am.

348
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:50,421
-Sure, just eat.
-Let's eat.

349
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:05,186
Hey.

350
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,441
What's going on?

351
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,528
Ms. Lee said she'd sue them,
but I haven't heard from her.

352
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:14,946
It'll take some time.

353
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:19,700
Is that all? Give me the details.

354
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,327
I have nothing to tell you.

355
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:26,541
Hye-jun seems amicable
and doesn't seem to hold grudges,

356
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:28,668
but he can be really stubborn at times.

357
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:30,836
Like that's going to change anything.

358
00:25:32,713 --> 00:25:35,132
Are you holding a grudge against me?

359
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,051
No.

360
00:25:37,552 --> 00:25:39,095
I said those things because--

361
00:25:39,178 --> 00:25:41,514
You trampled on my pride
so I could do better.

362
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:44,350
I understand.

363
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:46,936
Then why would you say
that I trampled on your pride?

364
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,355
-What is that about?
-What do you think?

365
00:25:49,438 --> 00:25:50,940
I'm saying I know you very well.

366
00:25:55,903 --> 00:25:57,321
Can I go to my room now?

367
00:25:57,905 --> 00:25:59,156
Go.

368
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,458
He's still holding that against me.

369
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:14,130
Of course he is. Even I still remember it.

370
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:17,758
I shouldn't expect him to get over it.

371
00:26:32,148 --> 00:26:33,733
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

372
00:26:33,816 --> 00:26:35,484
-With who?
-By myself.

373
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,404
-Don't you have anyone to eat with?
-It's not that.

374
00:26:40,156 --> 00:26:41,240
Hey.

375
00:26:41,949 --> 00:26:44,785
I'm trying to reach out to you.

376
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:51,000
I thought you did all those things

377
00:26:52,543 --> 00:26:53,961
out of love,

378
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:56,631
but I was wrong.

379
00:26:57,423 --> 00:26:59,508
You care a lot more about your life.

380
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:01,510
Whether I'm hurt or not,

381
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:04,263
you just want your life to be fabulous.

382
00:27:04,347 --> 00:27:07,558
You say that because you think
your life is separate from mine.

383
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:11,812
If I live a fabulous life, so will you.
It goes both ways.

384
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,565
Is it wrong that I think of you
as I do for myself?

385
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:16,359
You and I are different.

386
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,278
We have different upbringings.

387
00:27:19,362 --> 00:27:22,281
-Why would you think we're the same?
-I love you like I love myself,

388
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:24,825
so I want to make sure
you shine the brightest.

389
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:28,329
That's what I decided to do
even before you were born.

390
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:30,247
That won't work anymore.

391
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:49,350
Why are you so startled?

392
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:51,686
You always try to hit me.

393
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:53,813
It doesn't even hurt.

394
00:27:53,896 --> 00:27:56,816
That's not the point.
It instills fear in me.

395
00:27:57,316 --> 00:27:59,360
Do you actually feel fear?

396
00:28:00,736 --> 00:28:03,406
Seriously, what is going on with the kids?

397
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:07,493
If I tell you, you'll laugh at me

398
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,162
and ask me
what I've been doing all this time.

399
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:15,960
It's all your fault.

400
00:28:16,544 --> 00:28:18,504
I guess you'll blame everything on me now.

401
00:28:18,587 --> 00:28:20,881
Yes, everything is your fault.

402
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,426
I don't even know where to start.

403
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:27,555
No, I know exactly what went wrong.

404
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,599
It was when Hae-hyo entered
a public elementary school.

405
00:28:30,683 --> 00:28:31,726
Fine.

406
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:34,729
I get what's going on with him,
but what about Hae-na?

407
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:37,815
Is she dating some jerk
who went to that school?

408
00:28:37,898 --> 00:28:39,817
-Jin-u!
-Hey.

409
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:44,071
-Did I keep you waiting long?
-No. You must be hungry.

410
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,699
I'll take you to your favorite place.
Let's go.

411
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:00,921
-It's too expensive.
-You came here often with your mom.

412
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,715
Yes, but my mom paid for it.

413
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:06,260
<i>Since when did you consider
the price of meals?</i>

414
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:10,556
Let's just leave.

415
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:12,892
You should've said so
before we came in here.

416
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:14,310
You didn't say anything.

417
00:29:14,393 --> 00:29:18,814
Seeing the price on the menu
served as a reality check.

418
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:22,026
This is the only reality
I can offer you though.

419
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:23,944
I'd rather not be sad right now.

420
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,657
What's reality for me is sadness to you.

421
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:14,995
<i>My mom invited you over
for a meal this weekend.</i>

422
00:30:15,788 --> 00:30:16,997
<i>Did your mother leave?</i>

423
00:30:26,215 --> 00:30:27,758
<i>Thanks for the invitation.</i>

424
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,802
<i>My mom's staying for a few days.</i>

425
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:34,223
<i>Good night.</i>

426
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,535
"HAPPINESS IS SIMPLE AND FRUGAL"

427
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:57,037
MY RECENT MOST FAVORITE QUOTE,
FROM HYE-JUN

428
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:04,128
Are you cooking?

429
00:31:05,337 --> 00:31:07,173
It's nothing new.

430
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:08,632
You don't have any tofu.

431
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,177
The convenience store has some.

432
00:31:15,014 --> 00:31:16,348
Who's calling this early?

433
00:31:18,434 --> 00:31:19,768
I'm on tofu duty, I guess

434
00:31:27,234 --> 00:31:30,070
HYE-JUN

435
00:31:31,363 --> 00:31:33,282
-Hello?
-<i>Head outside.</i>

436
00:31:34,575 --> 00:31:37,077
-What?
-Check what's outside.

437
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:49,924
What is it?

438
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:51,383
FROM HYE-JUN

439
00:31:53,594 --> 00:31:56,639
No way! It's from Sa Hye-jun!

440
00:31:57,723 --> 00:32:00,226
-Mom!
-You said you two weren't dating.

441
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,019
He's crazy for you!

442
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:05,981
-Why would you--
-You sure are a cunning little minx.

443
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:10,110
I fell for a handsome man
who had nothing to offer

444
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,487
and paid for it harshly,

445
00:32:12,488 --> 00:32:13,739
but not you.

446
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:18,577
You won't be left with nothing
even if you do break up.

447
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:25,793
You haven't changed at all, have you?

448
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:28,504
How vulgar.

449
00:32:35,594 --> 00:32:36,887
Lend me some money.

450
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:43,727
Seeing how we've crossed all the lines
there are between a parent and a child,

451
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:47,022
there's nothing left to lose.

452
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:49,692
Let's go all the way.

453
00:32:56,991 --> 00:33:00,744
SA HYE-JUN

454
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:03,038
RATINGS PLUMMET FOR <i>THE FIRST HUMAN</i>
IS SA HYE-JUN TO BLAME?

455
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:04,832
What? <i>Out News?</i>

456
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,043
It's the same reporter.

457
00:33:08,127 --> 00:33:11,630
How does a 2.1 percent drop
qualify as a "plummet"?

458
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:13,382
Unbelievable.

459
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:17,720
Here you are. I've been looking for you.

460
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,348
Ms. Lee, I read an article.

461
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,309
-It's her, right?
-Yes.

462
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:25,060
How is Hye-jun the cause of this?

463
00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:26,687
It's the plot that's boring.

464
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,815
-I downloaded and watched it myself.
-Can't you see it when it airs?

465
00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:32,568
My family watching it
doesn't get added to the ratings,

466
00:33:32,651 --> 00:33:33,819
so it's of no use.

467
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,530
Why do articles like this keep surfacing?

468
00:33:36,613 --> 00:33:40,451
I've seen agencies block articles
for their actors on TV. Can't you do that?

469
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:42,661
I can't, so just give me
your written apology.

470
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,210
It has everything that it needs.

471
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,546
Save the compliments for others to give.

472
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:53,797
You're leaving already?

473
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,050
I need to head over to the set.

474
00:33:56,592 --> 00:33:59,345
With ratings lowering,
you can imagine what it's like.

475
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:00,929
Have a good one then.

476
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,175
It must be fate.

477
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:48,519
-Good job, everyone.
-Good job.

478
00:34:48,602 --> 00:34:51,438
-I thought Min-jae was coming.
-She's using the restroom.

479
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,900
Good job, everyone.

480
00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:58,779
Only two weeks left to go
and we're in a mess.

481
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:00,155
It's because of Sa Hye-jun.

482
00:35:00,656 --> 00:35:03,492
Background checks should be mandatory
before casting actors.

483
00:35:03,575 --> 00:35:05,577
All the skeletons in the closet
keep coming out.

484
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:10,416
The director is too nice to say anything,
but imagine his stress.

485
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:12,876
I never thought Sa Hye-jun was the type.

486
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,169
He's not.

487
00:35:15,629 --> 00:35:16,839
Let me apologize.

488
00:35:17,464 --> 00:35:19,508
The gossip surrounding Sa Hye-jun

489
00:35:19,591 --> 00:35:21,885
is due to my lacking as his agent.

490
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,014
We'll see you around.

491
00:35:31,854 --> 00:35:34,106
Would it kill them to at least apologize?

492
00:35:35,482 --> 00:35:36,733
That damn reporter.

493
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:38,694
Damn it!

494
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:41,196
ACCUSED: KIM SU-MAN

495
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,157
COMPLAINANT: SA HYE-JUN

496
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,337
Damn it.

497
00:36:01,258 --> 00:36:03,135
-Sir.
-Yes?

498
00:36:05,846 --> 00:36:07,389
I consulted with a lawyer

499
00:36:07,473 --> 00:36:09,892
and was told to settle
since the charges could stick.

500
00:36:10,976 --> 00:36:13,520
-Then go for it.
-But sir.

501
00:36:14,646 --> 00:36:17,232
Can't the legal team
talk to Sa Hye-jun on my behalf?

502
00:36:17,316 --> 00:36:19,443
But this isn't a company issue.

503
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:22,905
Once the bosses know, you'll get the boot.

504
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:24,072
But sir!

505
00:36:30,537 --> 00:36:32,956
You're the one who told me
to go for the jugular!

506
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:40,464
Sergeant Lee,

507
00:36:41,673 --> 00:36:44,259
let me have Sa Hye-jun's text messages.

508
00:36:46,386 --> 00:36:47,554
Just take this and leave.

509
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:52,392
How about a deal?

510
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,898
-There's another article.
-What article?

511
00:36:57,981 --> 00:36:59,608
That you're lowering the ratings.

512
00:36:59,691 --> 00:37:02,611
-It's the same one from this morning.
-And that makes it okay?

513
00:37:05,822 --> 00:37:06,907
How about…

514
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:10,035
we reveal the texts?

515
00:37:11,036 --> 00:37:12,829
It'll turn the tables.

516
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:15,749
I'm not that desperate yet.

517
00:37:19,461 --> 00:37:21,213
I want to take a vacation after this.

518
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:23,423
But I thought you were a workaholic.

519
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,842
Don't you want to review
the offers you received?

520
00:37:26,885 --> 00:37:28,095
No.

521
00:37:35,227 --> 00:37:36,270
JEONG-HA
THANK YOU

522
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:42,526
You must be tough mentally.

523
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,736
Me? I doubt it.

524
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,321
Nothing fazes you.

525
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:48,865
Says who?

526
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:50,867
I cry myself to sleep.

527
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:53,036
Really?

528
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,871
What you see isn't everything.

529
00:37:56,248 --> 00:37:58,041
I can smile during the day

530
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:00,294
because I cry at night.

531
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:03,297
That's cool too. I respect you.

532
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:22,691
<i>Do you know what it is?</i>

533
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:27,821
THE TREE THAT BRINGS JOY

534
00:38:29,865 --> 00:38:31,158
The tree that brings joy.

535
00:38:46,715 --> 00:38:48,717
<i>It feels surreal</i>

536
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,886
<i>that you're driving this truck.</i>

537
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,639
<i>And being together right now</i>

538
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:55,349
<i>doesn't feel real, either.</i>

539
00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:58,769
I want to record this moment.
One, two, three.

540
00:39:34,846 --> 00:39:38,725
I can't believe my Jeong-ha
can wash her hair on her own now!

541
00:39:39,893 --> 00:39:43,271
Just a second.
Let me apply some lotion on you.

542
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:48,985
<i>Round, and round, and round</i>

543
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:51,071
<i>Round, and round, and round</i>

544
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:52,989
<i>The warmth I felt back then.</i>

545
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:57,035
<i>That is enough of a reason</i>

546
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,538
<i>for me to forgive my mom.</i>

547
00:40:11,508 --> 00:40:16,388
MIN-JAE

548
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:23,186
<i>Hey, Jeong-ha.</i>

549
00:40:23,895 --> 00:40:27,274
Min-jae, when will Hye-jun
have some free time?

550
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:29,943
I need to talk to him.

551
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:37,033
It's so hard to get a hold of you.

552
00:40:38,326 --> 00:40:39,327
Right.

553
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:42,748
I'm sorry I stood you up that day.

554
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:45,375
You've apologized enough for that.

555
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:47,210
It's okay.

556
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,592
It's nice to finally be able
to talk to you face to face.

557
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:56,845
Same here.

558
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,933
I decided to listen to you
and take a break.

559
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:04,186
I kept working

560
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:07,189
because I was anxious.

561
00:41:10,442 --> 00:41:12,194
Getting this far wasn't easy.

562
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:17,741
You got this far

563
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:20,243
thanks to your hard work and tenacity.

564
00:41:24,372 --> 00:41:25,707
You're also level-headed

565
00:41:26,249 --> 00:41:28,251
and you never inconvenienced others.

566
00:41:29,002 --> 00:41:31,213
You're very passionate
when it comes to acting.

567
00:41:33,715 --> 00:41:35,717
It's nice to hear you put it that way.

568
00:41:38,094 --> 00:41:39,888
Thanks for noticing.

569
00:41:49,022 --> 00:41:51,608
Instead of apologizing,
we're thanking each other today.

570
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:10,210
I love you.

571
00:42:26,226 --> 00:42:27,269
We should break up.

572
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,991
Why?

573
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:52,043
Do you remember

574
00:42:55,463 --> 00:42:56,840
how you told me

575
00:42:58,049 --> 00:43:00,468
that you would never apologize
to the person you love?

576
00:43:14,441 --> 00:43:15,859
Just think about

577
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,487
how often you've apologized to me.

578
00:43:29,456 --> 00:43:30,373
I'm sorry.

579
00:43:39,132 --> 00:43:41,301
Every time you apologize,

580
00:43:44,512 --> 00:43:45,722
I can only think of

581
00:43:47,182 --> 00:43:50,060
how hard it must be for you.

582
00:43:53,647 --> 00:43:55,106
The Sa Hye-jun I know

583
00:43:56,274 --> 00:43:58,860
always stands by his words.

584
00:44:05,325 --> 00:44:08,119
I don't want to be your emotional outlet

585
00:44:10,372 --> 00:44:11,539
anymore.

586
00:44:20,465 --> 00:44:23,051
I want to go back
to before I fell in love with you.

587
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,025
Apologize to your mother for me.

588
00:44:52,372 --> 00:44:53,206
What is it?

589
00:44:56,418 --> 00:44:57,419
Let me drive you home.

590
00:45:00,171 --> 00:45:01,297
It's fine.

591
00:45:38,209 --> 00:45:39,043
That's

592
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:41,212
enough.

593
00:46:21,002 --> 00:46:22,337
That's barely 30,000 viewers.

594
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,798
Sa Hye-jun doesn't generate
much publicity anymore.

595
00:46:24,881 --> 00:46:27,509
How can he when he's
at the center of continuous scandals?

596
00:46:28,676 --> 00:46:30,845
"Stop using Hye-jun for publicity."

597
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:33,223
"Love between two people isn't a crime."

598
00:46:33,306 --> 00:46:36,601
"Who cares what the texts say?"

599
00:46:36,684 --> 00:46:39,312
"I hope Hye-jun sues his ass."

600
00:46:40,647 --> 00:46:42,774
The texts will end Sa Hye-jun's career.

601
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:44,776
Do you want to see them?

602
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,196
<i>If only I could actually show them to you.</i>

603
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,241
<i>What a bummer.</i>

604
00:47:07,507 --> 00:47:08,758
CHARLIE JUNG

605
00:47:08,842 --> 00:47:11,427
I KNOW YOU DON'T LOVE ME
BUT I REALIZE THAT YOU RESPECT ME

606
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:13,096
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU

607
00:47:26,526 --> 00:47:28,278
EMAIL

608
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:45,128
Hold on.

609
00:47:45,962 --> 00:47:47,088
Why are you home?

610
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:48,840
I'm not working today.

611
00:47:50,258 --> 00:47:51,801
Isn't Mom home?

612
00:47:51,885 --> 00:47:53,636
No, she went to work.

613
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:56,598
Why do you seem so glum?

614
00:47:58,558 --> 00:48:00,852
-It's nothing.
-I see.

615
00:48:00,935 --> 00:48:03,688
I bet Jeong-ha's thrilled
to have dinner with us.

616
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:07,859
She is,

617
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:10,486
but we'll have to reschedule.

618
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:11,905
Is she busy that day?

619
00:48:13,364 --> 00:48:15,742
Yes. It seems that way.

620
00:49:30,066 --> 00:49:32,110
SA HYE-JUN'S AGENCY DISCLOSES
CHARLIE JUNG'S TEXT MESSAGE

621
00:49:32,944 --> 00:49:35,154
THE RUMORS WERE PROVED TO BE FALSE

622
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,949
SA HYE-JUN REJECTED
CHARLIE JUNG'S ADVANCES

623
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,495
I guess his agency is close
with Choi Kang from Image News.

624
00:49:42,578 --> 00:49:44,580
<i>Image News</i> always gets the exclusives.

625
00:49:46,332 --> 00:49:47,458
Do you have anything?

626
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,169
We need to talk about the lawsuit.

627
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:52,463
My lunch must have been too salty.

628
00:49:52,547 --> 00:49:53,631
I need some water.

629
00:50:11,482 --> 00:50:13,151
I don't think I got here late.

630
00:50:17,363 --> 00:50:18,865
Were you surprised when I called?

631
00:50:18,948 --> 00:50:21,242
You're still as rude as ever.

632
00:50:21,743 --> 00:50:23,411
It really got on my nerves at first.

633
00:50:23,494 --> 00:50:25,079
I found you very amicable,

634
00:50:25,163 --> 00:50:27,165
so I was trying to be friendly
in my own way.

635
00:50:27,248 --> 00:50:30,626
Let me give you some legal advice
because you seem to like me so much.

636
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,755
You should settle.

637
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:38,801
-So I've been told.
-You can talk to me.

638
00:50:38,885 --> 00:50:40,053
Should I proceed with it?

639
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,347
I haven't decided yet.

640
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,643
Why are you so hostile against Hye-jun?

641
00:50:49,062 --> 00:50:51,481
I hate disloyal and selfish people.

642
00:50:51,564 --> 00:50:53,900
He dropped Lee Tae-su
when his agency went under

643
00:50:53,983 --> 00:50:56,152
and left with
JJamppong Entertainment's CEO.

644
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,154
Su-man.

645
00:50:59,072 --> 00:51:00,907
You've made me speechless.

646
00:51:01,574 --> 00:51:04,827
-What?
-You've got it all wrong.

647
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:07,205
Do you know
what Lee Tae-su put Hye-jun through

648
00:51:07,288 --> 00:51:08,956
by pocketing Hye-jun's pay?

649
00:51:09,749 --> 00:51:12,668
Of course, he said he'd pay him
once his agency did well.

650
00:51:13,252 --> 00:51:15,046
-What?
-I told him Mr. Lee was a fraud

651
00:51:15,129 --> 00:51:16,422
but he didn't listen to me.

652
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,051
No way.

653
00:51:20,134 --> 00:51:22,720
I've been checking your news articles.

654
00:51:23,387 --> 00:51:25,389
I know you want to criticize him more,

655
00:51:25,473 --> 00:51:28,351
but you might get a heavier sentence
for multiple offenses.

656
00:51:28,976 --> 00:51:31,187
Your company will not protect you.

657
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,523
They'll kick you out after the sentencing

658
00:51:33,606 --> 00:51:36,692
because you were overly enthusiastic
and harmed the company.

659
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:40,530
If you want to settle, call me.

660
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:58,256
-Hello.
-Hello.

661
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,716
Is there a lady who came alone?

662
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:06,806
I knew it. You know how to drink, Ms. Kim.

663
00:52:08,141 --> 00:52:10,518
Drinks are best had during the day.

664
00:52:10,601 --> 00:52:11,477
Okay.

665
00:52:13,604 --> 00:52:14,480
Go ahead.

666
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:16,566
How's work?

667
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:18,901
Is it going well?

668
00:52:18,985 --> 00:52:20,444
How could it go well?

669
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:22,280
The company is ignoring me.

670
00:52:24,157 --> 00:52:25,700
That's awful.

671
00:52:26,492 --> 00:52:28,536
I'm sure it will work out.

672
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:30,288
Or quit and become a YouTuber.

673
00:52:30,371 --> 00:52:34,041
Talking about the stories you know
from your job will be a huge hit.

674
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:35,418
You know that won't happen.

675
00:52:36,043 --> 00:52:37,211
You're right.

676
00:52:37,795 --> 00:52:40,256
The competition is fierce among YouTubers.

677
00:52:41,215 --> 00:52:44,468
If you knew that,
why did you encourage me to do it?

678
00:52:46,387 --> 00:52:49,432
You're a bit touchy today.

679
00:52:49,515 --> 00:52:52,185
The lawsuit
must have hurt you pretty badly.

680
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,689
But this is nothing in the long run.

681
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,279
<i>Something feels off.</i>

682
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,573
Why did you lie to me?

683
00:53:07,366 --> 00:53:09,952
Sa Hye-jun didn't betray you.

684
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:19,337
I did some digging
and found out you were famous

685
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,339
for stealing money from your clients.

686
00:53:23,174 --> 00:53:26,928
I never said he betrayed me.
I just said I lost him to her.

687
00:53:27,011 --> 00:53:28,971
It's valid from my perspective.

688
00:53:29,805 --> 00:53:32,683
I said I looked back on my actions
and want to bring him back,

689
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:34,602
so I can take good care of him.

690
00:53:35,102 --> 00:53:38,272
You were the one who interpreted it
the way you wanted.

691
00:53:38,356 --> 00:53:40,816
You can't blame this on me now.

692
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,693
The biggest asshole in life is someone

693
00:53:42,777 --> 00:53:45,696
who pretends to be the victim
when he's the assailant.

694
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,949
Calm yourself.

695
00:53:48,032 --> 00:53:51,285
Why are you suddenly acting
if any of this matters?

696
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:57,333
Mr. Lee, have you watched
the movie, <i>Veteran?</i>

697
00:53:57,416 --> 00:53:58,501
I did.

698
00:53:58,584 --> 00:54:01,128
"I don't have money, not self-respect."

699
00:54:01,212 --> 00:54:03,047
"I don't have money, not self-respect."

700
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:04,715
Do you think I'm a joke?

701
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,680
I'm going to bring
A June Entertainment down.

702
00:54:10,763 --> 00:54:14,267
Park Do-ha?
I'll keep exposing him to the public.

703
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:21,315
You pay for the drinks.
I don't have money.

704
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:26,862
She's freaking crazy.

705
00:54:30,825 --> 00:54:32,410
Have you been avoiding me?

706
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:36,747
Why would I do that?

707
00:54:37,915 --> 00:54:39,041
Don't you have a shoot?

708
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:40,710
It's over.

709
00:54:41,502 --> 00:54:44,672
Thanks to Sa Hye-jun,
your successful drama went down in flames.

710
00:54:44,755 --> 00:54:46,716
The ratings went down the gutter.

711
00:54:47,216 --> 00:54:49,176
It's because of the plot.

712
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:52,054
You're still protecting him, Hae-hyo.

713
00:54:52,138 --> 00:54:56,767
I thought we were a little closer
to each other. Was I wrong?

714
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:59,562
We've seen each other at our worst.

715
00:54:59,645 --> 00:55:02,732
I suddenly don't feel like working out
thanks to you.

716
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:04,984
You and I should have fun.

717
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,236
I know a fun place.

718
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:15,036
Is this the fun place?

719
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,288
It's so much fun once you get used to it.

720
00:55:17,371 --> 00:55:18,456
It's very private.

721
00:55:26,964 --> 00:55:30,343
It's been a while.
Gosh, you should have come more often.

722
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,179
Didn't you miss me?

723
00:55:34,638 --> 00:55:35,806
I'm leaving.

724
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:38,225
Hey, what's wrong?

725
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:40,144
Do you not like us?

726
00:55:40,227 --> 00:55:41,812
I have to be somewhere.

727
00:55:46,067 --> 00:55:47,026
Hey.

728
00:55:50,946 --> 00:55:53,282
Hey. I didn't know you were home, Hae-na.

729
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:54,992
Don't you have classes today?

730
00:55:55,076 --> 00:55:56,535
Ms. Han.

731
00:55:57,495 --> 00:55:58,871
I'm lonely.

732
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:01,665
You should date someone.

733
00:56:01,749 --> 00:56:04,543
Don't just study all the time.

734
00:56:09,256 --> 00:56:11,300
I want to gain weight

735
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:13,344
so I can get back at my mom.

736
00:56:15,304 --> 00:56:18,808
You must love your mother
as much as you love yourself.

737
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:21,685
I do?

738
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:24,688
It's unhealthy if you put on
a lot of weight over a short period.

739
00:56:24,772 --> 00:56:26,774
You're harming your own body,

740
00:56:26,857 --> 00:56:29,402
but you think you can hurt
your mom with that.

741
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:34,782
I thought sacrificing everything
for your children was pointless,

742
00:56:35,324 --> 00:56:36,492
but I guess it wasn't.

743
00:56:37,618 --> 00:56:38,661
Right.

744
00:56:40,454 --> 00:56:43,916
I guess Mom and I are connected
in ways I never imagined.

745
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:47,586
<i>I don't know what this is about.</i>

746
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,714
<i>But don't avoid her. Just talk to her.</i>

747
00:56:49,797 --> 00:56:51,382
<i>If you keep talking to her,</i>

748
00:56:51,465 --> 00:56:53,509
<i>you're bound to wear her down.
She's your mom.</i>

749
00:57:03,477 --> 00:57:04,729
Mom.

750
00:57:04,812 --> 00:57:05,813
That won't work.

751
00:57:08,357 --> 00:57:09,900
I lost.

752
00:57:09,984 --> 00:57:11,235
Is this a new plan?

753
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:13,863
Are you pretending to surrender
to persuade me?

754
00:57:17,324 --> 00:57:19,118
I guess this won't work, either.

755
00:57:20,453 --> 00:57:23,414
Isn't there any way for me to have my way?

756
00:57:23,497 --> 00:57:24,832
No.

757
00:57:43,267 --> 00:57:46,896
REPUBLIC OF KOREA MARINE CORPS

758
00:57:46,979 --> 00:57:48,814
ENLISTMENT DETAILS

759
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:05,080
Hye-jun.

760
00:58:17,885 --> 00:58:18,969
Are you tired?

761
00:58:24,725 --> 00:58:25,976
I don't have work today.

762
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:30,606
I did something really bad.

763
00:58:34,985 --> 00:58:38,364
I'd like to share
some very interesting news today.

764
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:43,202
Ms. Kim, you were the first one
to deliver us the news about Sa Hye-jun.

765
00:58:43,285 --> 00:58:45,621
Yes. That must be why many people assume

766
00:58:45,704 --> 00:58:48,415
he's the main subject of my news articles.

767
00:58:48,499 --> 00:58:49,375
I see.

768
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:52,336
This is the text message
Sa Hye-jun's agency sent.

769
00:58:52,419 --> 00:58:54,505
HYE-JUN, CONGRATULATIONS

770
00:58:54,588 --> 00:58:55,923
If he disclosed it sooner,

771
00:58:56,006 --> 00:58:59,093
he could have avoided speculations
and hate comments.

772
00:58:59,176 --> 00:59:01,887
From this, I could see how much
Sa Hye-jun respected

773
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,472
<i>the late Charlie Jung.</i>

774
00:59:04,431 --> 00:59:07,768
<i>As someone who reported about him
many times, it was quite heartwarming.</i>

775
00:59:07,852 --> 00:59:09,270
<i>I'm glad it's finally over.</i>

776
00:59:09,353 --> 00:59:12,940
<i>I look forward to hearing
more heartwarming stories about him.</i>

777
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,483
<i>Sure.</i>

778
00:59:17,111 --> 00:59:19,363
I didn't tell you in advance

779
00:59:19,446 --> 00:59:21,991
because I knew you wouldn't agree to this.

780
00:59:22,575 --> 00:59:24,660
Hye-jun. Oh, you're here, too.

781
00:59:26,537 --> 00:59:28,539
Is this a strategy meeting?

782
00:59:28,622 --> 00:59:29,957
What strategy meeting?

783
00:59:31,709 --> 00:59:34,545
The forums are a mess
since <i> Hot Issue Tok Tok</i> aired.

784
00:59:34,628 --> 00:59:38,090
They're saying he disclosed it
because he wanted to avoid criticism.

785
00:59:39,091 --> 00:59:40,926
I'm sure there are some nice comments.

786
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,178
-Yes, they are.
-Why bring up the bad news?

787
00:59:43,262 --> 00:59:46,390
Nice comments don't go viral.
You should have discussed it with me.

788
00:59:46,473 --> 00:59:49,268
You shouldn't have disclosed it like this.

789
00:59:50,227 --> 00:59:52,646
Why are you always unhappy
with everything I do?

790
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,857
It keeps repeating over and over again.

791
00:59:55,691 --> 00:59:58,944
If we try to fix it by releasing
a statement, it brings another problem.

792
01:00:00,571 --> 01:00:02,406
This is why I wanted to wait.

793
01:00:05,618 --> 01:00:08,537
I believed this was the best decision
we could make.

794
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,832
We haven't renewed our contract yet.

795
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:13,876
I will accept whatever decision

796
01:00:14,835 --> 01:00:15,878
you make.

797
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:27,848
PARK DO-HA RECEIVES EVALUATION
FOR MILITARY SERVICE

798
01:00:29,141 --> 01:00:30,517
<i>OUT NEWS</i> KIM SU-MAN

799
01:00:30,601 --> 01:00:32,811
Gosh, Kim Su-man.

800
01:00:33,395 --> 01:00:36,440
Damn it. I shouldn't
have made an enemy of her.

801
01:00:36,523 --> 01:00:38,233
Why did I do that?

802
01:00:38,859 --> 01:00:40,027
Why?

803
01:00:40,527 --> 01:00:41,820
Tae-su!

804
01:00:44,949 --> 01:00:47,826
I thought you were friends
with Kim Su-man, the reporter.

805
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,578
Why is there an article
about my military service?

806
01:00:49,662 --> 01:00:50,579
Do-ha.

807
01:00:52,289 --> 01:00:56,335
Do-ha. Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of everything.

808
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:59,380
You should focus on working out
for our next project.

809
01:01:01,507 --> 01:01:02,383
Can I trust you?

810
01:01:02,466 --> 01:01:04,510
Of course, you can.

811
01:01:04,593 --> 01:01:05,761
Trust me.

812
01:01:07,429 --> 01:01:08,639
<i>This is Jung Ji-a.</i>

813
01:01:08,722 --> 01:01:11,976
<i>Can I get my makeup done by you, Ms. An?</i>

814
01:01:22,736 --> 01:01:23,862
This way, please.

815
01:01:26,657 --> 01:01:28,283
I have a trial this afternoon.

816
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:32,121
I see. How about makeup that
makes you look soft, but elegant?

817
01:01:33,163 --> 01:01:34,289
Sounds good.

818
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,626
You don't have to worry

819
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:40,379
about Hye-jun and me. We're just friends.

820
01:01:43,924 --> 01:01:47,094
Men and women can't be friends.
On top of that, you're his ex.

821
01:01:50,347 --> 01:01:52,433
I don't think I can. I'm not that cool.

822
01:01:55,936 --> 01:01:58,856
If you're bothered by it,
I'll stop seeing him.

823
01:02:02,443 --> 01:02:05,529
No. I'm also his ex now.

824
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:14,496
That way, please.

825
01:02:23,505 --> 01:02:26,008
Ji-a isn't here yet. She's in court.

826
01:02:30,888 --> 01:02:32,014
When did you get here?

827
01:02:32,931 --> 01:02:33,974
A while ago.

828
01:02:34,641 --> 01:02:36,351
I'm clearing your schedule.

829
01:02:36,435 --> 01:02:38,687
I won't book anything
unless it's important.

830
01:02:40,606 --> 01:02:43,650
Okay. Let's talk
about our contract next week.

831
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:52,868
I'm sorry I'm late.

832
01:02:52,951 --> 01:02:55,287
It was a simple trial,
but there was a curveball.

833
01:02:56,914 --> 01:02:58,457
I asked to meet you here

834
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:01,627
because Ms. Kim wants to settle.

835
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:06,423
What do you want to do?

836
01:03:06,507 --> 01:03:07,925
What should I do?

837
01:03:09,343 --> 01:03:11,553
It's better to settle.

838
01:03:11,637 --> 01:03:14,431
I talked to her,
and she's not a vicious person.

839
01:03:14,515 --> 01:03:18,060
She only wrote those articles because
her initial intel was completely off.

840
01:03:20,437 --> 01:03:21,772
Then we'll settle.

841
01:03:22,397 --> 01:03:24,358
When her lawyer sends me their draft,

842
01:03:24,441 --> 01:03:26,485
I'll show it to you
after my boss confirms it.

843
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:30,072
If you think it's reasonable,
we'll finalize it.

844
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:31,615
Thanks.

845
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,080
Well,

846
01:03:38,872 --> 01:03:40,499
can we talk about something else?

847
01:03:45,337 --> 01:03:47,297
We're 28 now.

848
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:50,968
You were 20 when we first met.

849
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,764
A lot has happened since then.

850
01:03:57,391 --> 01:03:59,143
You will be

851
01:03:59,226 --> 01:04:02,771
the most beautiful
and sparkling part of my youth.

852
01:04:08,152 --> 01:04:09,153
Thank you.

853
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:17,369
I can finally let you go,
emotionally speaking.

854
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:28,046
I met with Jeong-ha.

855
01:04:28,714 --> 01:04:30,799
She seems nice and is the same age as us.

856
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:35,220
I want to be her friend
regardless of your relationship with her.

857
01:04:46,899 --> 01:04:48,400
<i>Do you remember</i>

858
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:50,360
<i>how you told me</i>

859
01:04:50,861 --> 01:04:53,947
<i>that you would never apologize
to the person you love?</i>

860
01:04:57,743 --> 01:05:00,662
<i>I know how busy you've been lately.</i>

861
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,331
I'm sorry

862
01:05:03,832 --> 01:05:05,626
for not replying to your texts.

863
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:10,380
I'm sorry
we can't spend much time together.

864
01:05:12,132 --> 01:05:13,091
<i>I'm sorry, Jeong-ha.</i>

865
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:15,093
I want to tell you the full story
in person.

866
01:05:15,886 --> 01:05:16,887
I'm sorry.

867
01:05:18,222 --> 01:05:19,306
I'm sorry.

868
01:05:22,017 --> 01:05:24,978
-I'm sorry.
-What are you apologizing for this time?

869
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:27,606
<i>Just think about</i>

870
01:05:28,899 --> 01:05:31,026
how often you've apologized to me.
