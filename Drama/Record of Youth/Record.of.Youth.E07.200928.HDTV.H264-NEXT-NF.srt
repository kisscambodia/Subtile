RECORD OF YOUTH

2
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,358
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS AN
"EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT" AND IS SUPPORTED

3
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:09,045
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, TOURISM
AND THE KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

4
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:27,362
You have to get the right amount.
Not too much, not too little.

5
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,657
What kind of answer is that?

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,410
-It's too hard.
-You'll get it once you practice a lot.

7
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:34,869
Open and close your eyes.

8
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:39,207
This feels comfortable.

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,668
The inner corner isn't covered,
so it doesn't sting.

10
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:44,087
Then, you should try this, too.

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,463
I got it.

12
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:47,757
You girls are having fun.

13
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:51,678
Keep having fun with her,
but don't forget I got you here.

14
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:54,431
If I continue to see you
fraternizing with her,

15
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:57,600
you'll be following in her footsteps.

16
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:00,228
Don't you know
how people think of her at our salon?

17
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,231
How do they think of me?

18
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,776
You're so clueless.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,279
You must be only interested in yourself.

20
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:11,740
You should have braced yourself

21
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,159
for a bad reputation
when you stole my clients.

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,619
The director called you.

23
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:26,713
MAKEUP ARTIST AN JEONG-HA

24
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:28,089
WON HAE-HYO: MAKEUP AND HAIR

25
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:29,924
LIST OF APPOINTMENTS

26
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:32,260
There aren't as many appointments
as I had hoped.

27
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:35,221
I know you just started.

28
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,515
I'm trying my best.

29
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,476
Of course. You're known as a hard worker.

30
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:43,563
But you must have a sense
of responsibility to help the salon

31
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:45,315
retain its clients and flourish.

32
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,068
And that sense of responsibility
leads to good performance.

33
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,737
It may not be fair to others
to promote you this way,

34
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,574
but I figured that it was worth it
even if there's backlash.

35
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:57,744
Please do a better job.

36
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:00,080
Okay.

37
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:02,707
Oh, right.
Professor Kim I-yeong is a VVIP.

38
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,334
Especially take good care of her.

39
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:07,087
But Professor Kim isn't my client.

40
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,255
Ma'am, Professor Kim is here.

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,510
I just wanted some water.
Why did you bring me to the director?

42
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:16,304
I'd be sad if you left without
seeing me when you came here.

43
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,681
Would you like some tea?

44
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,433
No, I want water. But no cold water.

45
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,311
Jin-ju, bring her some water.

46
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:26,856
Jeong-ha is her makeup artist.
Why don't we let them have a chat?

47
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,193
I guess there was a miscommunication.

48
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:32,946
I decided to get my makeup done by Jin-ju.

49
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:36,324
We rarely have communication problems.

50
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,201
But it seems there was one this time.

51
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,079
Better the devil you know.

52
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:44,833
But I'm not saying Jeong-ha is
a bad makeup artist.

53
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,417
I'm just comfortable with Jin-ju.

54
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:49,921
Making her clients comfortable
is an important skill.

55
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,047
Thank you.

56
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,383
I'll get that water for you.

57
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,524
-Jeong-ha.
-Getting your hair done?

58
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,318
No. I needed a pick-me-up.

59
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,030
Have you seen an agent who causes trouble?

60
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:24,289
I got a brand-new hairdo,
but I still feel shitty.

61
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,832
Yet, I have such a big appetite!

62
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,126
That happens if you're stressed out.

63
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:33,381
I've never lived for myself
after my father passed away.

64
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,926
I'm finally free after supporting
my mom and my siblings.

65
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,096
But I've never enjoyed my freedom,

66
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:42,473
so it scares me every day.

67
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,185
And I hide it by acting silly.

68
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:51,733
When I met you,
I thought you were special.

69
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:54,235
You were so lively.

70
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,613
Like a wild, untamed beauty.

71
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:59,032
I'm sure other people feel the same way.

72
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:02,160
"She's special.
I want to be friends with her."

73
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,121
You're sweet.

74
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:07,498
I get why Hye-jun likes you.

75
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:12,587
No.

76
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:17,133
I know you two are dating.
Hye-jun told me.

77
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:21,679
Once he's in love with someone,
his love becomes immeasurable.

78
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:26,517
Min-jae, hearing that
doesn't make me happy.

79
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,020
-Why not?
-That applies to his ex-girlfriend, too.

80
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:33,066
You must really like him.
You sound jealous.

81
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:35,151
No. I'm just stating the fact.

82
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:38,571
His love was immeasurable,
but they still broke up.

83
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:40,490
And now, he doesn't have

84
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:43,034
the slightest feeling left.
It's totally over.

85
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,370
Isn't that attractive?

86
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,165
Yes, it is.

87
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:50,750
And so is everything about him.

88
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,802
Can you

89
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:04,305
comfort Hye-jun?

90
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:07,183
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,519
I messed up.

92
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,854
But can you clean up my mess?

93
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,692
-No.
-Damn it.

94
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,735
I won't be able to make him feel better.

95
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,454
<i>THE PRESENT</i>

96
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,803
I BOUGHT THIS BOOK

97
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:49,809
BECAUSE I LIKED THE TITLE

98
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:56,524
"I also want to be a present to you."

99
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:00,820
That's so cheesy.

100
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,081
JEONG-HA

101
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,928
HYE-JUN

102
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,227
<i>Hi, Jeong-ha.</i>

103
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,481
<i>He's crying.</i>

104
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:39,484
Did you catch a cold?

105
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:41,986
No.

106
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,699
You sound like you have a cold.

107
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,117
I'm glad you don't though.

108
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,711
<i>He's not talking.</i>

109
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,880
<i>Is he still crying?</i>

110
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,929
I'm bored. Want to hang out with me?

111
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:11,391
<i>Sure.</i>

112
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:16,896
<i>I know how it feels
to get your heart broken.</i>

113
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:24,112
You're really good.

114
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:26,197
No, this looks awful.

115
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,826
Mastering the basics is the hardest,
and you did it on your first try.

116
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:32,036
I see talent.
You do take after me, you know.

117
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,165
She takes after you?

118
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:38,960
Ridiculous.

119
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,004
What good will it do?

120
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,049
Jeong-ha is still here. Be careful.

121
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,468
Jeong-ha, go out now.

122
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:49,554
I need to talk to your mom.

123
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:55,268
No, stay here.

124
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,478
She must know what's happening too.

125
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,606
Does playing with her fulfill your duty?

126
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,024
You can't even make a living.

127
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:04,819
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,946
Don't apologize. Go out and make money.

129
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:11,200
Get a manual labor job if needed.
You need to do anything you can.

130
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,661
Why must I take odd jobs and get insulted?

131
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:17,457
Even if I go to the employment center,
people won't hire me.

132
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,503
It's because they know

133
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,507
how irresponsible and weak you are.

134
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:32,388
Let's go.

135
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,852
Go with your mom.

136
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:39,896
I'm okay.

137
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,106
Let's go.

138
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,818
Will you disappoint me like your dad too?

139
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,279
Do you want me to die?

140
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,531
Hey, you crossed the line.

141
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:53,117
How can you say that to her?

142
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:55,536
This is the reality Jeong-ha is facing.

143
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,247
I'm going crazy
because of your incompetence.

144
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:02,418
I'm teaching her
she must be independent in this world.

145
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,214
I'm warning her.

146
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:08,591
She can't live like us.

147
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,022
He's not coming. Don't look back.

148
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:25,983
Only we can protect ourselves.

149
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,908
<i>My mom taught me the harsh reality
when I was nine.</i>

150
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,203
<i>And my dad taught me how to hold</i>

151
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,038
<i>-a pencil when sketching</i>.
-Like this?

152
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,164
Yes.

153
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:43,084
<i>-They both loved me.
</i>-Go ahead.

154
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,213
<i>And love</i>

155
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,132
<i>brought me sadness from the beginning.</i>

156
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,603
YEONGNAM REPAIR AND BUILDING

157
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:27,545
Here.

158
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:42,768
Here.

159
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,110
Why are you so nice to me?

160
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,821
Because you're my boyfriend.

161
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,449
Be nicer.

162
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:03,372
Ta-da.

163
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,499
That's why I got this.

164
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,549
Read this later.

165
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,551
Did you read it?

166
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:19,472
"When you are utterly focused on your job,

167
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:21,307
you won't be distracted, but happy."

168
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,269
How's that going for you?

169
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,229
I'm good at driving.

170
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,274
Then, you must be happy.

171
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:32,943
Are you happy?

172
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:35,738
Not yet.

173
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,575
Then, what about you? Is it going well?

174
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:41,369
I'm good at talking.

175
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:45,539
-So are you happy?
-Yes, I am.

176
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:47,666
Me, too.

177
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:53,714
<i>When I love this man, it makes me
want to become a better person.</i>

178
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,801
<i>And this man has a name.</i>

179
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,220
<i>Sa Hye-jun.</i>

180
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:14,944
That was cool.

181
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:44,932
<i>Searching for the stars</i>

182
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:50,104
<i>Sparkling in the night sky</i>

183
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,899
<i>I see your eyes blinking</i>

184
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:58,487
<i>Oh, how beautiful they are</i>

185
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:06,412
<i>I finally take the steps</i>

186
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:11,792
<i>After hesitating over and over again</i>

187
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:16,547
<i>And I will never forget</i>

188
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:25,347
<i>How you held my hand</i>

189
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:57,644
RECORD OF YOUTH

190
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,275
Thank you.

191
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,738
I can walk just fine.

192
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:05,823
Gosh.

193
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,828
What are you up to these days?

194
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,165
I'm trying to help you, Grandpa.

195
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:18,002
Dad was shocked after hearing
you fainted from overworking.

196
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,045
I'm all right.

197
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:23,632
I'm trying to help, you know.

198
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:45,321
What's all this?
Why didn't you clean this up?

199
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,492
This is Father.

200
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,329
-Right. That's Grandpa.
-What…

201
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,169
-This must be it.
-What?

202
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,380
He's been going to a modeling school.

203
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:06,300
Gosh, Grandpa looks like
a real model in the photos.

204
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,927
Hey. Do you think so?

205
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:10,596
Are you happy?

206
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,264
You reek of alcohol.

207
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:20,481
My goodness. This is a nice jacket.

208
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,158
Father.

209
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,661
Are you here to cause trouble for me?

210
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,957
No parents want to cause trouble
for their children.

211
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,420
Didn't I tell you I'd never see you
if you cause trouble again?

212
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,381
I want to be a proud dad to you.

213
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:47,341
I call you Father, not Dad.

214
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,468
But your children call you Dad.

215
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:54,473
Just like you, I want to be called Dad.

216
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,184
It sounds more endearing than Father.

217
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,269
Our relationship is not like that.

218
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,108
I regret what I did
hundreds of times every day.

219
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:06,026
"Had I been a better dad,

220
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,570
our family would have had
better lives now."

221
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,991
I want to go back to the past
and try again,

222
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,450
but I can't do that.

223
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,997
I was supposed to live a diligent life
from the beginning.

224
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,873
But I didn't know that.

225
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,543
-Don't talk to me as if you care.
-Yeong-nam.

226
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,714
I might not have been
a good father to you, but before I pass,

227
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,217
I want you to acknowledge
I tried my best to become a good one.

228
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,096
Why do you want that from me?
You've lived your life however you wanted.

229
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,890
No one can live like that in this world.
You punk.

230
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,102
That's not fair.

231
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,521
Gosh.

232
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:00,289
Is Father really going
to a modeling school?

233
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,959
Call Hye-jun.

234
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,003
He's not home?

235
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,339
I hit him because I was so livid.

236
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:12,176
You hit him? Did you hit our son?

237
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,303
He kept saying he did nothing wrong.

238
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,805
He was the one who paid
for Father's tuition.

239
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:19,349
-That hurts.
-Why would you hit him?

240
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,310
Do you think I'm happy I did?

241
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:22,936
Is that why you were drinking?

242
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,772
To make yourself feel a bit better?

243
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,901
Are you even curious
about where he could be now?

244
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,153
He's old enough to take care of himself.

245
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,699
He wasn't cast for the drama in the end.

246
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,868
Gosh.

247
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,745
They already gave the role to him once.

248
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,371
Why did they take it back?

249
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,123
Why would he put up with that?

250
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,294
Seriously. I wasn't going
to compare him to Hae-hyo,

251
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,839
but if he were born into
a rich family like Hae-hyo,

252
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,967
he would've been famous long ago.
But he got struck out with us.

253
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,594
Don't talk like that.

254
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,097
Go out and find Hye-jun.

255
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:13,070
Dad, you have me.

256
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,408
Hye-jun seems amicable
and doesn't seem to hold grudges,

257
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,285
but he can be really stubborn at times.

258
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,163
Like that's going to change anything.

259
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,207
I hit him once
when I was in middle school,

260
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,042
and I can't say a word to him now.

261
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:29,294
He goes berserk.
He doesn't even forget it.

262
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,048
He won't forget what I did, then.

263
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,427
Dad, you're too softhearted.

264
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,097
How will you live without me?

265
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,933
What am I going to do? I'll miss you.

266
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,101
I can always come.

267
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:47,813
Why isn't he home already?

268
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,523
He has to help me move tomorrow.

269
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,537

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,747

-Finish.
-You had to finish the song.

283
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,987
I finish once I start something.

284
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,322
What a show-off.

285
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,781
No, I'm just good.

286
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,368
I agree. You're cool.

287
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,374
What is it?

288
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,669
This is comforting.

289
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,517
Let's go, cheetah.

290
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:11,855
Yes, cheetah!

291
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,901
There's nothing wrong with it, you know.

00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:19,279

-So what if I am?

294
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,175
Sorry about that.

295
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,640
Thanks.

296
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,360
What?

297
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,779
What?

298
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,369
There's something I want to do,
but I need your permission first.

299
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,623
You have it.

300
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,442
I thought about it,

301
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,154
and you're always allowed.

302
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,282
Can I be too?

303
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:48,952
Do whatever pleases you.

304
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,632
We should've taken the cart.

305
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,300
I can't believe this long walk.

306
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:48,011
We haven't been
out on the field for a while.

307
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:51,556
I thought it'd be nice to have a chat too.
You love to chat.

308
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,391
Doing what I really want

309
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,102
is how you get me in a chatty mood.

310
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:59,106
You always do whatever you want though.

311
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,440
-Hold on.
-How can I possibly…

312
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,193
Can you pull over?

313
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,736
Is it someone you know?

314
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:06,863
I know them.

315
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,494
Hello, Mother.

316
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,124
<i>You're a douchebag.</i>

317
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,583
Mother,

318
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,878
don't you think that's a little harsh?

319
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:24,506
Mother, my ass.

320
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,342
How can you possibly
manage my son's career

321
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,970
when you don't even know
what's appropriate?

322
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:32,472
I'm not interested in
what you have to say.

323
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:38,228
You can't insult someone
over some chump change.

324
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,689
When it comes to money,
even a penny matters.

325
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:44,317
You keep failing
because you know nothing about money.

326
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:49,322
End the contract with my son
and get out of our lives.

327
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:50,574
Do so, and I'll back off.

328
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,035
Mr. Lawyer, go ahead.

329
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:00,792
I didn't think we'd cross paths again,

330
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,752
but here you are.

331
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:05,213
What a wonderful day.

332
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,341
<i>What the hell? Is he challenging me?</i>

333
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,844
Yes, hello.

334
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,513
When I last saw you, Mother…

335
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:16,558
Oh, sorry. It's inappropriate
to call you that, right?

336
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,269
Anyway, here you go.

337
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,190
A June Entertainment.

338
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,275
Isn't that Korea's
top entertainment agency?

339
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,277
We're not exactly number one,

340
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,155
but we're at least in the top five.

341
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,574
I'm a director there by title,

342
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:36,870
but it won't be a stretch to say
that I take care of most of the business.

343
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:37,954
I see.

344
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,372
<i>A director at A June?</i>

345
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,292
<i>What a joke.</i>

346
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,251
Do-ha!

347
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,837
Come on over and say hello.

348
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:47,923
She's an acquaintance of mine.

349
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,342
Hurry on over.

350
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:53,970
Hello.

351
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,264
I'm not exactly up-to-date
on Korean celebrities,

352
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,892
-but I've heard of you.
-Thank you, sir.

353
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:01,603
You know Hae-hyo, right?
They are his parents.

354
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,272
I see.

355
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,359
We filmed a movie together recently.

356
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:08,902
<i>He's not so dense after all.</i>

357
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,696
<i>What is this? The duo from hell?</i>

358
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,700
It was great to meet you,
but we should get going.

359
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,702
Well, I wish you a good G today.

360
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,289
Have a good day.

361
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,335
What's a good G?

362
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,546
He and his cheap choice of words.

363
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,173
Does G stand for golfing?

364
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,551
Shouldn't he wish us
a good "round" of golf?

365
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:35,262
Have a good R!

366
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,222
Was that seriously the takeaway for you?

367
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,308
Anyway, go ahead. I have a call to make.

368
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:41,393
Sure.

369
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,529
CAN PARK DO-HA MAKE A COMEBACK WITH <i>CATCH</i>?

370
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:54,447
GO KILL YOURSELF

371
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:57,367
Sons of bitches.

372
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,494
They still want me to kill myself.

373
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,540
Did you receive hate comments again?

374
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:04,916
Just don't mind any of them.

375
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,461
You suck at empathizing.

376
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:16,803
I'm your manager.

377
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,389
My job is to solve issues,

378
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:22,517
not hold your hand
and sulk with you regarding the matter.

379
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,978
This is because you were too nice.

380
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,023
You should've taught your haters a lesson,

381
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,733
not let them off the hook.

382
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:33,236
You know what haters say, right?

383
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,363
"I've been having a hard time."

384
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:37,324
"My life sucks."

385
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,951
"I'm sorry,
but stress got the best of me."

386
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:42,662
They are all lies.

387
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:45,623
Haters are just bastards, not sick or ill.

388
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:48,460
Why can't you just listen to me?

389
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,174
You know,

390
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,676
you're decent at times,

391
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,721
but you also get on my fricking nerves.

392
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,891
You blabber way too much.

393
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:05,685
Don't forget that your job is to serve me.

394
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,479
There's a line you shouldn't cross.

395
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:11,107
<i>I empathize with his situation
but he chews my head off in return.</i>

396
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,779
I was going to announce it
and sue all their asses this week

397
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:18,031
all the while informing the media.

398
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:21,701
So for now,
let's play a round of golf, Actor Park.

399
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:31,628
<i>You ungrateful brat.</i>

400
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,976
INCOMING CALL
MS. KIM I-YEONG

401
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,977
Yes, Mom.

402
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,605
Have you heard about Lee Tae-su?

403
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:52,273
<i>He's a director at A June.</i>

404
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,775
<i>One with shares.</i>

405
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:56,778
So it's true.

406
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:59,614
<i>Justice is never served in this world.</i>

407
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:02,575
-Why?
-I met him at the golf club.

408
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,203
Did you read Mr. Yoon's new script?

409
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:06,830
Yes, I found it intriguing.

410
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:09,040
Seriously?

411
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,709
Yes, I liked it.

412
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,712
Who's the lead?

413
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:16,798
It's not a done deal yet,
but Park Do-ha and Jessica.

414
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:18,216
Are you and Park Do-ha close?

415
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:21,052
Not really, but we get along.

416
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:23,847
<i>He's over-the-top at times,
but easy to read.</i>

417
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,140
Do you want to be in it?

418
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:26,349
Sure, I do.

419
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:27,892
Why though?

420
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,728
Got it.

421
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:41,740
JEONG-HA

422
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,997
<i>The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail after--</i>

423
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,713
JEONG-HA

424
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:59,549
<i>Sorry I can't take your call.
I'll call you back a.s.a.f.</i>

425
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:01,259
A.s.a.f?

426
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:04,512
Shouldn't it be "a.s.a.p"?

427
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:08,349
I hate people who can't spell properly.

428
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,654
SUPERSTAR SA

429
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:32,957
Yes, superstar…

430
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:34,751
I mean, Actor Sa.

431
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,420
Come to the cafe near my house
in 30 minutes.

432
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:40,173
But I'm in the middle of a meal.

433
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,216
<i>Is that a no?</i>

434
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,179
As if I'd ever say that to you.

435
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:47,764
<i>Of course, I can be there.</i>

436
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:49,599
See you soon then.

437
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,485
You must be enjoying that.

438
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,948
Of course, I am.

439
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:08,660
The chunks of fruit
make the drink seem fresher.

440
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,788
How delightful, right?

441
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:13,873
Yes, delightful.

442
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,295
Must you be this way?

443
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,798
This is you abusing your power as my boss.

444
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,342
That's only true
if you were still my manager.

445
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:28,012
Saying I'd think about it
was my way of asking you not to let me go.

446
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,015
I'm new at this, you know.

447
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,726
Unlike you,
I'm not experienced in this field.

448
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,229
Isn't that worth a bonus?

449
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,939
Only when you show competence.

450
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,441
Then let me show you
just how competent I am.

451
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:42,735
You know the casting director Song Jae-su?

452
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:45,196
-Yes.
-He wants a model-turned-actor.

453
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:48,283
No acting skills required.
Just good looks.

454
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:49,534
That's all he needs.

455
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:54,956
This is exactly
what I've been getting you ready for.

456
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,041
I owe my good looks to my parents.

457
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,377
Hand me an olive branch, will you?

458
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,588
-Must I audition?
-An interview is required.

459
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:02,881
Then set up a date.

460
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,507
I already have. Tomorrow at 3 p.m.

461
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:09,095
You seem different today.

462
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,347
Did something good happen?

463
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:19,188
Where are you off to?

464
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:21,024
To help my brother move out.

465
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,243
All right. It's all done now.

466
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,418
Take care. All those years…

467
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,546
Well, they weren't really great.

468
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,964
May this be our last moment.

469
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,927
Is this all you need?
What about your desk?

470
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,013
A table comes with the house, you know.

471
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,264
Are you that thrilled?

472
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:56,017
Hye-jun's waiting for you outside,
so get going.

473
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,603
Couldn't he come in
and help with the suitcases?

474
00:32:58,686 --> 00:32:59,979
You're doing just fine.

475
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,357
Why make him do it
when you're still strong enough?

476
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:09,238
Jeez, Dad. That was ice-cold.

477
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:11,866
Without you, I'll be all alone.

478
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,870
<i>I'm a loner, I'm a loner</i>

479
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,291
You backstabbing brat.

480
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:26,798
Grandpa, Mom, and Dad.

481
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,968
-Don't skip your meals.
-Yes, sir!

482
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,137
You're over the moon, aren't you?

483
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,432
Why aren't you upset
when our son's moving out?

484
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:38,393
You're the weird one here.

485
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:39,560
He's 28.

486
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:41,896
We should celebrate his independence.

487
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:43,856
What are you yelling at me for?

488
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:47,568
From what I can tell,
she wasn't scolding you.

489
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,404
She was only explaining the situation.

490
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:51,781
As you know,
she's always had good judgment.

491
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,324
Whatever.

492
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,660
-We'll get going then.
-Sure.

493
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,497
-Drive safely.
-Got it.

494
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:09,048
YEONGNAM REPAIR AND BUILDING

495
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:21,144
Dirty cups keep on piling.
Let me take over.

496
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,395
No, I've got this.

497
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:25,815
I guess you can head straight home
after joining Hae-hyo on set.

498
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:27,775
Right.

499
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:36,993
-Su-bin.
-Yes?

500
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,538
What do people think of me here?

501
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:46,794
Just tell me how it is.

502
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:50,006
I hate being the only fool here.

503
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:52,925
They have the wrong idea about you.

504
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:54,719
Whatever I say can't correct it.

505
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:58,347
I'd like to hear their exact words.

506
00:34:58,431 --> 00:34:59,932
Only then can I take measures.

507
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,727
It's never ideal to be the messenger, so…

508
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:13,071
They say you've been selectively
stealing Jin-ju's male clients.

509
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:14,238
Jeez.

510
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,369
I bet it pisses you off.

511
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,163
It does.

512
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:24,624
Still, I have a job to do.

513
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,377
-Can you wash the rest as well?
-Got it.

514
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:30,463
Jeong-ha.

515
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:32,298
Good luck!

516
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:34,884
Good luck to me.

517
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:45,186
Did something bad happen?

518
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:47,772
No.

519
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:50,441
I'm just considering it
as something common.

520
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,778
There's no such thing
as a smooth path in life.

521
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:58,449
So what you mean is that
you're on a rugged path

522
00:35:58,533 --> 00:35:59,951
which is making your life hard.

523
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:03,663
Why are you driving to set by yourself?

524
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,958
I just wanted some peace and quiet.

525
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:09,794
Okay, then I'll keep quiet.

526
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:13,172
How's Hye-jun doing?

527
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:16,092
I wonder why I'm asking you.

528
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,970
Maybe you think I'll have the answer.

529
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,765
He makes you laugh even on a rugged path.

530
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,559
I guess it shows his competence.

531
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,102
He sure is.

533
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:12,023
-Nice and clean, right?
-Right.

534
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:14,775
You can come by at times.
Not too often, though.

535
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:16,027
The inside's even better.

536
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:18,321
All right.

537
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,199
That's odd.

538
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,498
Wait, do I have the wrong unit?

539
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:31,500
UNIT 502 PASSCODE: 1388*

540
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,419
-What…
-Is this the right place?

541
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,421
I'm not that stupid, you know.

542
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,340
Jeez, all right. Why won't it open then?

543
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:39,342
This is unit 502.

544
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:42,053
-What…
-Let me see.

545
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,179
What the hell?

546
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:46,724
Why are you trying to get into my house?

547
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,392
You're the one who's trespassing.

548
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:51,479
And those pajamas.
It's like you're living here.

549
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:52,730
Because I am living here.

550
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,024
You're the fifth person today

551
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:56,859
who claimed that this place is theirs.

552
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,028
So how can I not be cranky?

553
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,197
How can we believe
you're the actual owner?

554
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,949
-Nicely asked.
-You've been scammed,

555
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:05,201
so report it to the police.

556
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:08,746
Call your realtor.

557
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:10,248
Right.

558
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,291
Goodness.

559
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:13,834
Damn it.

560
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:16,921
The number you've dialed
has been disconnected.

561
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:17,880
What?

562
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:20,508
The number you've dialed is…

563
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:22,176
Why has it been disconnected?

564
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,221
Wait…

565
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:27,181
What…

566
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,141
-We apologize.
-Damn it.

567
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:40,820
This can't be.

568
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,281
It isn't!

569
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:45,324
<i>Lower your voice and get lost!</i>

570
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,410
Let's go.

571
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:49,704
No, I can't.

572
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:51,622
I won't take a single step

573
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:54,041
until I get to the bottom of this.

574
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,712
We already know half of the story,

575
00:38:57,795 --> 00:38:59,171
so let's figure out the rest.

576
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:03,301
-Hey! But…
-Keep it down, will you?

577
00:39:04,677 --> 00:39:05,553
Hye-jun.

578
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:09,265
I'm telling you. This is my place!

579
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:10,891
Wait…

580
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:13,201
The power of attorney form.

581
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:15,454
My seal.

582
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:19,332
A copy of the register.

583
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,376
My contract for unit 502.

584
00:39:22,836 --> 00:39:25,005
The owner was Kwon Nam-hui

585
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:27,883
and this is the bank account.

586
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,551
TRANSACTION RECEIPT

587
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:32,387
It belongs to Kwon Nam-hui, too.
Everything's perfect.

588
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:34,931
I know. You perfectly fell for the scam.

589
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:38,477
Five people
have signed a lease for unit 502.

590
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,562
How many times must I tell you this?

591
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,481
That Kwon Nam-hui

592
00:39:42,564 --> 00:39:44,941
just has the same name
as the real owner of the unit.

593
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,904
He says this is a dual contract.

594
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:52,157
You signed a lease
for a unit that is being rented out.

595
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,617
I heard him, you know.

596
00:39:54,117 --> 00:39:56,912
The owner could be an accomplice
who's lying about all this.

597
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,164
The homeowner will be questioned too.

598
00:39:59,706 --> 00:40:03,043
So please head home and wait.
We'll reach out to you.

599
00:40:03,627 --> 00:40:05,837
Does this mean
he'll lose the entire deposit?

600
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:08,256
Should I give you hope?

601
00:40:12,594 --> 00:40:13,637
Shit…

602
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:25,273
Gyeong-jun, I'm hungry.

603
00:40:30,278 --> 00:40:31,822
Let me buy you dinner.

604
00:40:31,905 --> 00:40:33,406
As if I'm in the mood to eat.

605
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:19,911
Can we get two more portions
of pork belly?

606
00:41:19,995 --> 00:41:22,581
Sure thing.
Two more portions of pork belly!

607
00:41:23,415 --> 00:41:25,709
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

608
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,128
And steamed eggs, please.

609
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:29,796
Steamed eggs, too!

610
00:41:54,154 --> 00:41:57,032
YOU HAVE NEW MAIL

611
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:01,077
FROM LEE YEONG-SU
BCZTV, THE WORLD'S TOP MCN

612
00:42:01,161 --> 00:42:04,581
<i>Hello. I'm Lee Yeong-su, partner manager
at BCZTV's Korea team.</i>

613
00:42:04,664 --> 00:42:07,667
<i>We would like to offer you a partnership.</i>

614
00:42:24,184 --> 00:42:25,810
<i>Cut</i>. Okay.

615
00:42:25,894 --> 00:42:28,688
-Good job, everyone.
-Good job!

616
00:42:28,772 --> 00:42:30,649
-Bye.
-Good job.

617
00:42:30,732 --> 00:42:32,192
Good job, everyone.

618
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:35,111
I'll get going then.

619
00:42:35,695 --> 00:42:37,530
Hae-hyo will take you home.

620
00:42:37,614 --> 00:42:38,865
I want to go alone.

621
00:42:39,366 --> 00:42:40,951
-Tell him I said bye.
-Okay.

622
00:42:46,706 --> 00:42:47,791
-Good work.
-Good work.

623
00:42:47,874 --> 00:42:49,042
-Great job.
-Thank you.

624
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:59,010
Where is she going?

625
00:42:59,094 --> 00:43:00,428
She wants to go alone.

626
00:43:22,158 --> 00:43:23,243
<i>I'm Hye-jun's fan.</i>

627
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,161
<i>Don't tell Hye-jun.</i>

628
00:43:25,245 --> 00:43:28,123
<i>I bet you like him even more now.
I know how great he is.</i>

629
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,541
Right. I do like him more.

630
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:32,669
<i>So I'm trying
not to develop feelings for him.</i>

631
00:43:33,795 --> 00:43:36,256
<i>I was totally determined not to date him,</i>

632
00:43:36,756 --> 00:43:38,133
<i>but I couldn't resist.</i>

633
00:43:39,551 --> 00:43:42,345
<i>Am I doing the right thing, Hae-hyo?</i>

634
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:55,317
Hey.

635
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,279
What?

636
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:02,907
Hey, don't be startled.

637
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:04,743
What's going on?

638
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:13,752
I wanted to say bye.

639
00:44:13,835 --> 00:44:15,045
To end the day properly.

640
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,882
Okay, let's end the day properly.

641
00:44:19,966 --> 00:44:22,218
Get home safely. Good work today.

642
00:44:22,844 --> 00:44:23,928
Bye.

643
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:37,817
Don't go.

644
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,056
It doesn't look that difficult,
but I guess it's hard.

645
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:09,182
Yes.

646
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:13,520
It's actually harder than it looks.

647
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,608
Why didn't you tell us?

648
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:21,152
I wanted to become successful
and surprise you all.

649
00:45:21,778 --> 00:45:24,656
Yeong-nam wouldn't say
anything nice about it.

650
00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:27,867
I was also worried
about what you'd think of it.

651
00:45:27,951 --> 00:45:29,327
You made a great decision.

652
00:45:30,036 --> 00:45:31,371
-Let me try.
-Sure.

653
00:45:31,454 --> 00:45:32,622
-It looks easy.
-Okay.

654
00:45:33,915 --> 00:45:37,127
All right. Exhale.

655
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:40,547
Flatten your stomach.

656
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,423
-Like this, Father?
-Yes, that's it.

657
00:45:44,592 --> 00:45:46,136
Gosh, it's hard.

658
00:45:47,387 --> 00:45:48,847
My goodness.

659
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:50,890
What are you doing this late?

660
00:45:51,474 --> 00:45:53,101
None of your business.

661
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:54,394
Your hearing is too good.

662
00:45:56,479 --> 00:45:59,399
This brat, can't he call and tell us
how the move went?

663
00:45:59,482 --> 00:46:01,151
Why can't you call him?

664
00:46:01,234 --> 00:46:03,069
Not until he calls us first.

665
00:46:03,153 --> 00:46:04,988
He seemed so excited to move out.

666
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,324
Of course, he's very excited.
Think about it in his shoes.

667
00:46:08,408 --> 00:46:10,243
I envy him.

668
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:26,718
Get out.

669
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:44,861
You take that.

670
00:46:54,829 --> 00:46:55,705
What are you doing?

671
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:57,999
Those bastards.

672
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:01,377
I'm just so angry.

673
00:47:02,212 --> 00:47:03,671
Gosh, I'm really upset.

674
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,591
I can't believe I got conned
by those jerks.

675
00:47:06,674 --> 00:47:08,009
Just accept it already.

676
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:11,137
The sooner you accept it,
the better it is for you.

677
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:12,555
I can't go in.

678
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:14,974
How am I going to face everyone?

679
00:47:15,058 --> 00:47:16,684
But you have to, eventually.

680
00:47:21,356 --> 00:47:22,357
Hey.

681
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:25,109
I have a job that everyone wants,

682
00:47:25,693 --> 00:47:29,447
but my monthly salary is
what rich kids spend on a purse.

683
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:32,951
I can't buy a house in Seoul
with that money. I'll never be rich.

684
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:36,329
I'll live this way and keep struggling
until the day I die.

685
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:39,082
I just wanted to live alone and feel free.

686
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:42,043
You know,
I wanted to forget about the family

687
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:44,379
and about my duty as the eldest son.

688
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:46,881
And this, seriously?

689
00:47:47,715 --> 00:47:49,008
What did I do so wrong?

690
00:47:49,592 --> 00:47:52,053
What have you ever done
for the family as the eldest son?

691
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:54,389
I always cared deeply about the family.

692
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:57,433
If you care with all your heart,
it shows eventually.

693
00:47:57,517 --> 00:48:00,687
Who's talking so loudly
in front of my house?

694
00:48:02,855 --> 00:48:03,856
Oh, hey.

695
00:48:04,732 --> 00:48:06,317
Gyeong-jun, what's going on?

696
00:48:07,402 --> 00:48:09,737
What happened?
Why did you bring your stuff back?

697
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:11,990
Hey, what is going on?

698
00:48:12,073 --> 00:48:13,283
Ask Gyeong-jun.

699
00:48:16,911 --> 00:48:18,538
I don't want to carry this!

700
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:24,168
But the thing is…

701
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:29,090
Why did you bring that back?

702
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:35,722
Hey! Why are you here?

703
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:44,814
What is going on?

704
00:48:44,897 --> 00:48:46,607
I don't know. They won't say.

705
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:47,734
-Gyeong-jun!
-Hold on!

706
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:51,195
I think

707
00:48:53,114 --> 00:48:55,241
it'd be better to ask this one.

708
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:02,165
Hye-jun, tell us what's going on.

709
00:49:02,248 --> 00:49:04,876
You guys are making us think
that something bad happened.

710
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:06,419
It is something bad.

711
00:49:07,795 --> 00:49:09,005
Was he conned?

712
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:12,342
The realtor received money

713
00:49:12,425 --> 00:49:15,636
from multiple people
for the same apartment and ran off.

714
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,847
They'll look into it for more information.

715
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,807
Who said that?

716
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:21,267
We went to the police station.

717
00:49:21,351 --> 00:49:23,978
I knew it. I thought it was too cheap.

718
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,064
I can't believe this.

719
00:49:26,147 --> 00:49:28,399
How could Gyeong-jun fall for a scam?

720
00:49:28,483 --> 00:49:30,360
Did he not go over the lease thoroughly?

721
00:49:30,443 --> 00:49:31,861
It's not his fault.

722
00:49:32,487 --> 00:49:35,239
You just fall for it
when someone is determined to scam you.

723
00:49:35,323 --> 00:49:36,949
Those who have never experienced it

724
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:40,703
think that the ones who got scammed
weren't careful enough,

725
00:49:40,787 --> 00:49:43,331
but that is not true at all.

726
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:46,250
Look at you all excited
to show off your expertise.

727
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:48,002
Why did he want to move out now?

728
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:49,962
I told him to save up enough money first.

729
00:49:50,046 --> 00:49:53,132
It's useless to talk about it now.
Think about how upset he must be.

730
00:49:53,216 --> 00:49:56,094
He's never experienced it before.
He must be devastated.

731
00:49:56,177 --> 00:49:59,138
You're so understanding.
Why can't you be like that to others?

732
00:49:59,222 --> 00:50:02,725
Mom's right.
I think you owe me an apology, Dad.

733
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:06,312
Hey, an apology for what?

734
00:50:06,396 --> 00:50:07,730
For hitting me.

735
00:50:09,482 --> 00:50:12,318
I also think you should apologize to him.

736
00:50:12,402 --> 00:50:14,153
-Father.
-Even parents should apologize

737
00:50:14,237 --> 00:50:15,822
when they did something wrong.

738
00:50:15,905 --> 00:50:18,282
You know I apologize to you all the time.

739
00:50:18,366 --> 00:50:20,326
It's wrong to put your pride first.

740
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:22,829
Whose fault is it that I hit him?

741
00:50:22,912 --> 00:50:24,372
One thing at a time.

742
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,499
Gyeong-jun getting scammed, then Hye-jun.

743
00:50:26,582 --> 00:50:28,584
Now, it's about Father.
Then this won't end.

744
00:50:28,668 --> 00:50:30,795
The rental scam is the biggest news today,

745
00:50:30,878 --> 00:50:32,338
so that's that.

746
00:50:36,092 --> 00:50:38,678
Ae-suk summarized it all for us.

747
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:12,795
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

748
00:51:17,216 --> 00:51:18,426
Sweet dreams.

749
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:21,637
SWEET DREAMS

750
00:51:22,221 --> 00:51:25,641
I received a partnership offer
from a multi-channel network today.

751
00:51:25,725 --> 00:51:29,228
At the moment, I'm not sure
if I should continue to do this alone

752
00:51:29,312 --> 00:51:32,064
or partner up with others.

753
00:51:32,148 --> 00:51:34,233
I'll meet them first and let you know.

754
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:37,695
<i>THE PRESENT</i>

755
00:51:37,778 --> 00:51:41,073
"When you are utterly focused on your job,

756
00:51:41,157 --> 00:51:43,910
you won't be distracted, but happy."

757
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:51,584
I'm holding on to some complex feelings.

758
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,920
It's March already.

759
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,630
Don't catch a cold.

760
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:59,884
Thank you for watching Jeong-ha's Story.

761
00:52:19,278 --> 00:52:21,572
Let's focus on the meal when we're eating.

762
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:24,158
And we should have a conversation.

763
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:26,244
You always say
we should have a conversation,

764
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:28,204
but never have anything to talk about.

765
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,832
A real conversation should be fun
even when it's about nothing important.

766
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:34,794
Find a housekeeper who's a good cook.

767
00:52:34,877 --> 00:52:37,964
The older you get,
the less you should eat to stay healthy.

768
00:52:38,047 --> 00:52:41,133
You eat out every day,
so let's eat light when we're at home.

769
00:52:41,217 --> 00:52:42,843
You cook well. Why don't you cook?

770
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:44,428
Because I don't want to.

771
00:52:46,806 --> 00:52:48,516
And you want a conversation?

772
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:51,227
Okay, fine. I'll try to find someone.

773
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:53,062
Ask Hye-jun's mother.

774
00:52:53,145 --> 00:52:54,730
I'll take care of it, okay?

775
00:52:55,648 --> 00:52:57,066

<i>I'm meeting with

<i>I miss you.</i>

787
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:06,218
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

788
00:54:09,805 --> 00:54:11,140

00:54:12,266 --> 00:54:13,976
<i>I can't believe this!</i>

790

You said it'd just be an interview.
<i>Gateway</i>--

791
00:54:18,272 --> 00:54:20,816
If it's the resident role,
that's an amazing opportunity.

792
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:24,904
Well, I just didn't want you
to get your hopes up too high.

793
00:54:24,987 --> 00:54:26,072
He might not get it.

794
00:54:26,155 --> 00:54:29,533
Whether he gets it or not, the fact
that he can audition for it is amazing.

795
00:54:29,617 --> 00:54:30,993
Hello.

796
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:33,913
Oh, Hye-jun. You look great.

797
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:37,249
Can you wait about ten minutes
before you come in?

798
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:38,709
I've talked to the director.

799
00:54:39,585 --> 00:54:40,670
Wait.

800
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:46,717
Gosh, seriously!

801
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:55,226
Seriously, I can't stand him! Song Jae-su…

802
00:54:56,018 --> 00:54:57,144
Right, Song Jae-su.

803
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:59,772
I even hate his name.

804
00:55:00,356 --> 00:55:02,483
Lee Tae-su. Song Jae-su.

805
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:05,152
Tae-su, Jae-su!

806
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:08,864
I hate this!

807
00:55:08,948 --> 00:55:10,157
What's going on?

808
00:55:13,285 --> 00:55:14,203
Hey.

809
00:55:16,414 --> 00:55:18,457
<i>Gateway.</i> You've heard of it, right?

810
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:21,585
The medical drama starring the top actor,
Lee Hyeon-su.

811
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:25,548
The role you're auditioning for
is a first-year resident in that drama.

812
00:55:25,631 --> 00:55:28,634
The read-through is done,
and the shoot will begin next week.

813
00:55:28,718 --> 00:55:30,970
It'll be amazing if you get this role.

814
00:55:31,595 --> 00:55:35,057
Then I'll have to memorize medical terms.
There will be a lot to prepare for.

815
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:38,185
It's mainly about romantic relationships.

816
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:41,397
And that character doesn't do much
as a doctor.

817
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,109
All you have to do is follow Lee Hyeon-su
around and say, "I like you so much!"

818
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:48,320
How amazing is that?

819
00:55:48,404 --> 00:55:51,991
You and Lee Hyeon-su in the same frame.
You'll become more popular.

820
00:55:58,372 --> 00:55:59,832
Let me fix this.

821
00:55:59,915 --> 00:56:01,375
What are you doing?

822
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:04,253
Hey, you need to look sexy.

823
00:56:04,336 --> 00:56:06,630
-Show this off. Come on.
-What's your problem?

824
00:56:06,714 --> 00:56:07,715
Show this off!

825
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:10,092
What on earth are you doing?

826
00:56:10,885 --> 00:56:14,346
Hye-jun, let's do this. Just this time.

827
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,724
-Come on. Just this once.
-No, no!

828
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:17,933
-Just this once.
-Gosh.

829
00:56:18,017 --> 00:56:19,810
-My goodness!
-What are you doing?

830
00:56:26,796 --> 00:56:29,548
Thank you for the offer.

831
00:56:30,257 --> 00:56:31,759
And I'm curious.

832
00:56:31,842 --> 00:56:35,387
What's your criteria for selecting who
to reach out to regarding partnership?

833
00:56:36,013 --> 00:56:37,014
Well…

834
00:56:38,057 --> 00:56:39,558
I reach out to whoever I like.

835
00:56:40,392 --> 00:56:43,896
I don't like channels
that are all about money

836
00:56:43,979 --> 00:56:47,149
or determined to become famous
so that they can become successful.

837
00:56:47,691 --> 00:56:48,984
I'm not drawn to them.

838
00:56:49,068 --> 00:56:53,280
I like people who try to create
better content to help others.

839
00:56:54,323 --> 00:56:57,910
And that's why I like your channel.

840
00:56:58,994 --> 00:57:00,162
Thank you.

841
00:57:01,038 --> 00:57:02,706
We'll split the profits 60-40.

842
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:08,254
Well… I was intrigued
by your selection criteria for a moment.

843
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:10,840
I like people who want to make money
and become famous

844
00:57:10,923 --> 00:57:14,802
through their channels
because that's just a human instinct.

845
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:20,266
The terms you mentioned tell me that
you're following such an instinct, too.

846
00:57:20,808 --> 00:57:24,019
But I guess you like channels
that deal with classical content.

847
00:57:26,856 --> 00:57:28,983
Have you had any part-time jobs?

848
00:57:29,066 --> 00:57:31,026
Yes, many.

849
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:32,736
Like what?

850
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:36,532
As a bodyguard.
I've also worked at a sandwich shop,

851
00:57:37,324 --> 00:57:39,702
and grilled meat and served
at a restaurant as well.

852
00:57:39,785 --> 00:57:42,288
I still work there
because the owner and I are close.

853
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:45,082
You sound like the loyal type.

854
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:50,212
Well, that's something
you should ask my close friends.

855
00:57:50,296 --> 00:57:51,297
-Right.
-That's true.

856
00:57:53,382 --> 00:57:55,134
He's very well-spoken as well.

857
00:58:06,729 --> 00:58:09,356
HAE-NA

858
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,110
Hae-na, honey, it's me.

859
00:58:15,112 --> 00:58:18,824
No. She won't like this.

860
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:21,076
Ms. Won Hae-na.

861
00:58:22,494 --> 00:58:25,247
This is Mr. Kim Jin-u.

862
00:58:25,331 --> 00:58:28,792
Let's talk about the rights A can exercise

863
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:31,086
to acquire ownership
over the piece of land.

864
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:34,548
Of course, this will be reflected
in your final grade.

865
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:39,386
To fully acquire ownership over the land
from B,

866
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:42,348
A must evict C
and demolish the temporary building.

867
00:58:43,432 --> 00:58:46,518
But can A claim for removal of disturbance

868
00:58:46,602 --> 00:58:49,104
when the ownership
hasn't been transferred to him yet?

869
00:58:49,688 --> 00:58:51,607
A is not the owner of the land.

870
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:55,277
Hence, A cannot claim
for removal of disturbance.

871
00:58:55,361 --> 00:58:58,239
The key here is,
whether or not A can exercise

872
00:58:58,322 --> 00:59:02,076
B's rights on his behalf as his creditor.

873
00:59:04,286 --> 00:59:08,082
-You're Jung Ji-a?
-The answer is… Yes, he can.

874
00:59:13,629 --> 00:59:14,630
Ji-a!

875
00:59:17,174 --> 00:59:19,969
-Is the exam keeping you busy?
-Well, you know.

876
00:59:20,052 --> 00:59:21,804
You'll pass it, of course.

877
00:59:22,805 --> 00:59:26,642
We're participating in a mock trial
competition. Can you help us?

878
00:59:27,851 --> 00:59:29,270
I have huge respect for you.

879
00:59:29,353 --> 00:59:32,564
All right. Pick the time and place
and send me the theme.

880
00:59:32,648 --> 00:59:34,942
I'll give you a few pointers then.

881
00:59:35,025 --> 00:59:36,694
Thank you.

882
00:59:37,194 --> 00:59:39,363
I feel like I've known you for years.

883
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,497
What are you doing here?

884
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:51,375
-Do you know that guy?
-"That guy"?

885
00:59:54,044 --> 00:59:57,923
Ms. Won Hae-na, you're so mean to me.
How could you do this to your honey…

886
00:59:58,007 --> 01:00:01,051
You told me not to say that,
but I'm just so used to it now.

887
01:00:02,094 --> 01:00:03,971
You hurt Mr. Kim Jin-u's feelings.

888
01:00:07,016 --> 01:00:09,184
-Are you two dating?
-No!

889
01:00:09,268 --> 01:00:10,769
He's just my brother's friend.

890
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:12,938
You're Hae-hyo's sister?

891
01:00:13,022 --> 01:00:14,106
You know my brother?

892
01:00:14,898 --> 01:00:15,733
Yes.

893
01:00:16,775 --> 01:00:20,195
Hey, you showed up unannounced
to see your ex-girlfriend?

894
01:00:20,279 --> 01:00:22,031
That might count as stalking.

895
01:00:22,114 --> 01:00:24,533
"Stalking"? Hey, don't you know how I am?

896
01:00:24,616 --> 01:00:25,909
I'd never do that.

897
01:00:25,993 --> 01:00:28,412
Even criminals say
it's unfair that they got arrested.

898
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:31,415
Ji-a. To be exact,
this wasn't unannounced.

899
01:00:31,498 --> 01:00:33,083
He did send me multiple texts.

900
01:00:33,709 --> 01:00:35,919
You came here even though
she ignored your texts?

901
01:00:36,003 --> 01:00:37,212
That's called obsession.

902
01:00:37,296 --> 01:00:38,797
I will leave.

903
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,720
Honey, if you want to talk… I mean,

904
01:00:46,055 --> 01:00:49,224
if you want to talk with Kim Jin-u,
give me a call.

905
01:00:54,313 --> 01:00:57,149
Jin-u! Nice seeing you.

906
01:00:57,232 --> 01:00:58,776
You're mean.

907
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:08,577
We'll put wainscoting panels over here.

908
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,497
And we'll install partitions
in the kitchen.

909
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,123
How many boards do you need?

910
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:15,709
About two bundles?

911
01:01:15,793 --> 01:01:16,752
Two bundles?

912
01:01:18,295 --> 01:01:20,089
-You're working so hard.
-Oh, hello.

913
01:01:20,172 --> 01:01:22,257
I just wanted to stop by.

914
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:24,218
-Here, have some of this.
-Thank you.

915
01:01:24,301 --> 01:01:26,678
My son will live here
after he gets married,

916
01:01:26,762 --> 01:01:29,264
but they're busy with work,
so they can't stop by.

917
01:01:29,348 --> 01:01:31,350
Don't worry. We'll do a good job.

918
01:01:31,433 --> 01:01:32,810
Thank you.

919
01:01:32,893 --> 01:01:34,395
Have a good day, then.

920
01:01:34,478 --> 01:01:36,563
-You, too.
-Take care.

921
01:01:37,606 --> 01:01:39,566
Her son must be around Gyeong-jun's age.

922
01:01:40,401 --> 01:01:43,529
Hey, I'm sure
he's not as smart as Gyeong-jun.

923
01:01:44,321 --> 01:01:47,157
I feel like I have to prepare
for Jin-u's retirement as well.

924
01:01:47,241 --> 01:01:48,117
Jang-man.

925
01:01:48,992 --> 01:01:50,661
Look at us growing old together.

926
01:01:51,245 --> 01:01:53,080
We only talk about our kids these days.

927
01:01:53,163 --> 01:01:54,456
Were you aware of that?

928
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,541
You're right.

929
01:01:55,624 --> 01:01:56,625
Goodness.

930
01:01:56,708 --> 01:02:00,170
Gosh. Had I been competent enough,

931
01:02:00,254 --> 01:02:02,548
Gyeong-jun would've never fallen
for that scam.

932
01:02:03,841 --> 01:02:06,218
Nothing in life is going my way.

933
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:08,929
Let's go out for dinner.

934
01:02:09,012 --> 01:02:12,349
That's one of the few things in life
that you have full control over.

935
01:02:13,225 --> 01:02:14,768
Invite Ae-suk, too.

936
01:02:14,852 --> 01:02:15,769
She won't come.

937
01:02:15,853 --> 01:02:17,604
We'll tell her you aren't there.

938
01:02:18,397 --> 01:02:20,858
Jeez. Have fun without me, then.

939
01:02:23,318 --> 01:02:26,029
Do you know anyone who's a good cook?

940
01:02:26,113 --> 01:02:28,323
A good cook? Yes, I do know of someone.

941
01:02:28,407 --> 01:02:30,951
I'm looking for someone
who can come here twice a week.

942
01:02:31,034 --> 01:02:33,370
Just dropping off
some side dishes would work too.

943
01:02:33,454 --> 01:02:35,330
I'm not sure, but I'll ask.

944
01:02:35,414 --> 01:02:36,290
Thanks.

945
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,927
<i>Ae-suk, how about a drink this evening?</i>

946
01:02:50,179 --> 01:02:53,265
The squid mouth and some peanuts.

947
01:02:53,348 --> 01:02:55,309
Then wrap them like this.

948
01:02:56,226 --> 01:02:58,395
Then dip it in the sauce.

949
01:03:03,942 --> 01:03:05,027
It's good.

950
01:03:06,528 --> 01:03:09,072
Honey, you should eat some too.
I made all this for you.

951
01:03:09,156 --> 01:03:10,949
I'm sorry I ate first.

952
01:03:11,033 --> 01:03:14,578
No, it's okay.
I gave him an earful this morning.

953
01:03:14,661 --> 01:03:16,330
Are you protesting because of that?

954
01:03:16,413 --> 01:03:20,375
No, it's not that. I can't stop
drinking this because it's so refreshing.

955
01:03:21,168 --> 01:03:22,669
Work must have been exhausting.

956
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:24,463
You two are a match made in heaven.

957
01:03:25,047 --> 01:03:26,965
You'd argue and make up right away.

958
01:03:27,049 --> 01:03:30,469
Whenever Ae-suk gets upset with me,
she sulks for quite a while.

959
01:03:30,552 --> 01:03:32,554
-That's because
-Ae-suk!

960
01:03:32,638 --> 01:03:34,515
you always bad-mouth me behind my back.

961
01:03:35,098 --> 01:03:36,391
Hi.

962
01:03:36,475 --> 01:03:37,935
My gosh, what is this?

963
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:39,436
We'll get another beer.

964
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:44,316
You must be upset because of Gyeong-jun.

965
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,325
Why bring it up? It's nothing exciting.

966
01:03:53,408 --> 01:03:56,703
It's okay.
Everyone's bound to find out anyway.

967
01:03:58,163 --> 01:04:00,791
We haven't done this in a while,
so let's drink.

968
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:03,252
Yes, you're awesome!

969
01:04:03,335 --> 01:04:07,256
Ae-suk, it'll be just the two of you
after your kids get married,

970
01:04:07,339 --> 01:04:09,174
so be good to him.

971
01:04:09,258 --> 01:04:11,385
She's always good to me.

972
01:04:11,969 --> 01:04:14,179
I know I'm not good enough for you.
I'm sorry.

973
01:04:16,223 --> 01:04:19,935
Look at him scoring some brownie points.

974
01:04:20,018 --> 01:04:21,353
Hey, this is heavy.

975
01:04:21,436 --> 01:04:23,438
All right. We're in this together!

976
01:04:23,522 --> 01:04:25,440
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

977
01:04:25,524 --> 01:04:28,569
-Gosh.
-I have the most fun with you guys.

978
01:04:28,652 --> 01:04:31,905
You're always full of energy.
Maybe it's because you work.

979
01:04:31,989 --> 01:04:33,365
Yes, it does help.

980
01:04:33,448 --> 01:04:35,158
How about I try doing what you do?

981
01:04:36,243 --> 01:04:37,703
You? How?

982
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:40,747
Why not? I'm a good cook.

983
01:04:40,831 --> 01:04:42,958
You're too opinionated.

984
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:46,128
You have to completely cater
to your employer to make things easier.

985
01:04:46,211 --> 01:04:48,005
I'm good at that too.

986
01:04:48,088 --> 01:04:50,841
I see that you really underestimate me.

987
01:04:50,924 --> 01:04:53,176
Hae-hyo's family
is actually looking for someone.

988
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,053
Oh, I want the job.

989
01:04:55,137 --> 01:04:56,930
Don't decide so impulsively.

990
01:04:57,014 --> 01:04:58,515
Think about it first.

991
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:00,350
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

992
01:05:00,434 --> 01:05:01,643
Sure, sounds good.

993
01:05:01,727 --> 01:05:02,936
-Bye.
-Bye.

994
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,896
-Bye. Good night.
-Bye.

995
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:06,064
-Let's go.
-Okay.

996
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:08,191
Are the kids home?

997
01:05:29,963 --> 01:05:32,132
Seven, eight,

998
01:05:32,841 --> 01:05:35,010
nine, ten.

999
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:40,515
You won't tell me what's up?

1000
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:45,479
Gosh, what's wrong?

1001
01:05:46,438 --> 01:05:47,522
Get off me.

1002
01:05:47,606 --> 01:05:48,899
Are you mad at me?

1003
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:55,072
No. Why are you here?

1004
01:05:55,947 --> 01:05:57,366
What's taking Hye-jun so long?

1005
01:05:58,116 --> 01:06:02,120
He's so head over heels for a girl that
he doesn't even care about his friends.

1006
01:06:02,913 --> 01:06:05,082
Yes, I think so too.

1007
01:06:07,793 --> 01:06:09,378
What are you guys doing?

1008
01:06:10,629 --> 01:06:11,546
Hye-jun.

1009
01:06:12,964 --> 01:06:15,008
-What's with you?
-Hear me out--

1010
01:06:15,092 --> 01:06:18,011
-Go away.
-Oh, he got dumped.

1011
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,805
Seriously?

1012
01:06:29,147 --> 01:06:30,232
Who is she?

1013
01:06:30,315 --> 01:06:32,734
I'll teach her a lesson. This is so mean.

1014
01:06:34,903 --> 01:06:36,113
I ran into Ji-a today.

1015
01:06:37,406 --> 01:06:38,782
How?

1016
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:43,161
Oh. I thought I saw her,
but it wasn't her.

1017
01:06:44,037 --> 01:06:45,288
She's in law school, right?

1018
01:06:45,372 --> 01:06:47,666
-Hae-na's school.
-Let's not talk about her.

1019
01:06:50,669 --> 01:06:53,171
Did the audition go well? <i>Gateway</i>.

1020
01:06:53,255 --> 01:06:54,840
You auditioned for <i>Gateway</i>?

1021
01:06:54,923 --> 01:06:56,717
Lee Hyeon-su is in it, right?

1022
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,968
I love her.

1023
01:06:58,051 --> 01:06:59,302
I'd love to work with her.

1024
01:06:59,386 --> 01:07:01,972
-You're not the only one.
-That's right.

1025
01:07:02,055 --> 01:07:05,225
I want to work with her too.
But I have no control over that.

1026
01:07:09,563 --> 01:07:10,647
What are you doing?

1027
01:07:11,273 --> 01:07:12,441
I want to go home.

1028
01:07:13,608 --> 01:07:14,776
You guys are boring.

1029
01:07:17,654 --> 01:07:18,822
What's with him?

1030
01:07:32,377 --> 01:07:35,046
CASTING DIRECTOR SONG JAE-SU

1031
01:07:37,883 --> 01:07:38,842
Hello, Mr. Song.

1032
01:07:38,925 --> 01:07:43,388
Hello, we'd like to see Hye-jun again
tomorrow.

1033
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:48,435
I don't want to take him back there
if he doesn't stand a chance.

1034
01:07:48,518 --> 01:07:50,395
I don't want to put him through that.

1035
01:07:52,063 --> 01:07:54,608
You don't sound so interested in the role.

1036
01:07:54,691 --> 01:07:57,027
Okay, then we'll find someone else
for the role.

1037
01:07:58,403 --> 01:08:00,155
Mr. Song, wait!

1038
01:08:02,616 --> 01:08:03,742
I'm sorry.

1039
01:08:04,576 --> 01:08:07,871
I was eating cup noodles,
but I think something's wrong with it.

1040
01:08:08,663 --> 01:08:11,124
Thank you. Thank you so much!

1041
01:08:13,835 --> 01:08:15,045
Nice.

1042
01:08:15,128 --> 01:08:16,505
Oh, my gosh.

1043
01:08:20,592 --> 01:08:22,469
Gosh, this is nice.

1044
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,515
That was your phone.

1045
01:08:26,598 --> 01:08:27,682
It must be Jeong-ha.

1046
01:08:30,894 --> 01:08:33,522
<i>Hye-jun, you got the role.
This isn't a dream, right?</i>

1047
01:08:34,022 --> 01:08:35,690
<i>You got the role in </i>Gateway.

1048
01:08:35,774 --> 01:08:37,567
<i>Only happy days await us from now on.</i>

1049
01:08:40,111 --> 01:08:41,154
You look so happy.

1050
01:08:42,113 --> 01:08:43,657
-I got it.
-What?

1051
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,659
The role in <i>Gateway.</i> Min-jae texted me.

1052
01:08:45,742 --> 01:08:47,744
Hey, that's awesome. Congratulations.

1053
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:49,621
Thanks.

1054
01:08:50,121 --> 01:08:51,164
Get home safely.

1055
01:08:51,248 --> 01:08:52,249
You, too.

1056
01:09:56,396 --> 01:09:58,356
Stay there. I'll come.

1057
01:10:06,531 --> 01:10:09,868
There's something I wanted to tell you
before today was over.

1058
01:10:16,374 --> 01:10:17,334
I got the role.

1059
01:10:19,294 --> 01:10:20,587
Because of my face, I think.

1060
01:10:21,171 --> 01:10:23,006
I didn't show them my acting.

1061
01:10:24,215 --> 01:10:26,509
If you did, they'd be knocked out.

1062
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,806
I'm grateful to have you by my side
right now.

1063
01:10:38,313 --> 01:10:39,356
Let's go, cheetah.

1064
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:42,984
Where are we going?

1065
01:10:43,902 --> 01:10:45,320
Just around the block.

1066
01:11:44,421 --> 01:11:47,132
-Hi.
-Shouldn't you be giving me an update?

1067
01:11:47,215 --> 01:11:50,468
Right. Male, age 13. Mental stupor.
His pupils are five and three.

1068
01:11:50,552 --> 01:11:52,470
No reflex in the right leg.

1069
01:11:52,554 --> 01:11:54,222
-Diagnosis?
-We're suspecting ICH

1070
01:11:54,305 --> 01:11:55,640
and status epiletip…

1071
01:11:58,268 --> 01:11:59,602
Sorry.

1072
01:11:59,686 --> 01:12:01,646
I'm sorry. I apologize.

1073
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:03,773
Sorry about that.

1074
01:12:04,649 --> 01:12:05,567
It's okay.

1075
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:09,112
Medical terms are so difficult.
My brain is about to explode.

1076
01:12:09,946 --> 01:12:11,239
But you're always perfect.

1077
01:12:11,322 --> 01:12:14,784
I always try to do a really good job
in the scenes with my juniors.

1078
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,078
It's embarrassing, you know.

1079
01:12:17,912 --> 01:12:19,664
That's how you'll grow as an actor.

1080
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:23,334
All right, shall we try again?

1081
01:12:23,418 --> 01:12:25,628
We'll start again from the beginning.

1082
01:12:25,712 --> 01:12:26,713
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

1083
01:12:26,796 --> 01:12:29,174
We'll start again from the beginning.

1084
01:12:38,516 --> 01:12:40,560
Specimen.

1085
01:12:41,686 --> 01:12:43,396
Specimen.

1086
01:12:44,647 --> 01:12:45,774
Why are you still here?

1087
01:12:49,277 --> 01:12:50,320
Hello.

1088
01:12:50,403 --> 01:12:51,696
The shoot is over.

1089
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,785
I can't leave
because I did such a bad job.

1090
01:12:59,162 --> 01:13:01,498
So how much longer
are you going to stay here?

1091
01:13:01,581 --> 01:13:02,957
Until the shoot next week.

1092
01:13:04,959 --> 01:13:05,960
Hye-jun.

1093
01:13:06,044 --> 01:13:07,337
Yes?

1094
01:13:09,047 --> 01:13:10,673
Go home and wash up.

1095
01:13:10,757 --> 01:13:13,843
Then go over your next scene in your head.

1096
01:13:13,927 --> 01:13:16,179
It's lame to torture yourself.

1097
01:13:16,262 --> 01:13:17,597
Let's not be lame.

1098
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:20,100
Thank you so much.

1099
01:13:21,309 --> 01:13:23,561
Next time you see me, just talk casually.

1100
01:13:31,653 --> 01:13:32,695
<i>Hae-jin.</i>

1101
01:13:54,801 --> 01:13:56,010
Did you finish tidying up?

1102
01:14:02,016 --> 01:14:03,476
What is it? You're scaring me.

1103
01:14:05,562 --> 01:14:06,604
Can I ask you out?

1104
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:13,209

RECORD OF YOUTH

1106
01:15:42,075 --> 01:15:43,910
-I can't see a thing.
-Missed me?

1107
01:15:44,494 --> 01:15:46,287
<i>I'm happy I'm dating such a good guy.</i>

1108
01:15:47,163 --> 01:15:49,123
He can't really afford to be dating now.

1109
01:15:49,207 --> 01:15:50,541
Today, I have nothing to say.

1110
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:52,252
You devoted your life to raise me?

1111
01:15:52,335 --> 01:15:53,461
<i>Why don't I recall that?</i>

1112
01:15:53,962 --> 01:15:56,798
Lucky you. Everyone likes you
the moment they meet you.

1113
01:15:58,549 --> 01:16:00,927
-He's always been good looking.
-Of course.

1114
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:02,553
I feel terrible, you see.

1115
01:16:02,637 --> 01:16:04,347
Have you heard of a Charlie Jung?

1116
01:16:05,431 --> 01:16:08,601
<i>Congratulations on your career.
I'm happy it took off.</i>
