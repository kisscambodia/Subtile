<i>Why do you hate rainy days?</i>

5
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:52,782
<i>It makes me feel like I'm all alone.</i>

6
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:01,040
-Mom!
-Mom!

7
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,335
<i>-To kids, umbrellas on rainy days…</i>
-Bye.

8
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:05,253
Goodbye.

<i>…symbolize protection from adults.</i>

<i>After growing up,</i>

11
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:16,681
<i>I didn't expect anyone
to give me an umbrella.</i>

12
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,643
<i>That day, my dad told me </i>

13
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:24,063
<i>he had watched me
until he couldn't see me anymore.</i>

14
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:29,027
<i>He should have run to me
instead of just watching me go away.</i>

15
00:01:30,904 --> 00:01:34,324
<i>For kids, things must be clear
for them to understand.</i>

16
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,798
<i>I wanted to watch him until I couldn't.</i>

17
00:01:52,383 --> 00:01:54,552
<i>Did he turn around to see me again?</i>

18
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:58,556
<i>If he turned around,</i>

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,516
<i>was he disappointed that I wasn't there?</i>

20
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:04,062
<i>Small things like this sway my emotions.</i>

21
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:07,357
<i>I know this is a part of being in love.</i>

22
00:02:08,983 --> 00:02:10,276
<i>Even until then,</i>

23
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,112
<i>I hadn't accepted such emotions.</i>

24
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,409
<i>When it came to love,
I was only a nine-year-old kid.</i>

25
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:26,042
-It's cold.
-Let's go inside.

26
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:31,214
-But this is a new car.
-It's okay. Get in.

27
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:38,596
Put this over you for now.

28
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:42,809
Let's see.
Where's the button for the heater?

29
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,229
Gosh. Hold on. Where's the button?

30
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,022
Is this it?

31
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:50,108
Oh, no.

32
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:57,115
I think I got the right one this time.

33
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,574
I got it.

34
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:00,868
<i>-What will happen to us?</i>
-See? I got it.

35
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:04,872
<i>We crave this uncertain
and unpredictable relationship.</i>

36
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:08,126
<i>That day,</i>

37
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:10,878

EPISODE 9

42
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:52,670
Hello.

43
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:26,370
Did you call the director
of <i>The King Returns</i>?

44
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:27,872
I don't like that drama.

45
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:30,875
"When you and I disagree,
we will follow my decision."

46
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:32,668
That was my condition.

47
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:35,546
Come on. You must follow up
with a romantic drama.

48
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:37,381
What's my schedule today?

49
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,718
Hair salon at 11 a.m.,

50
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:43,721
<i>interview with </i>Out News<i> at 2 p.m.,
and commercial shoot at 5 p.m.</i>

51
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:45,223
Min-jae.

52
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:48,184
Can I sign an exclusive contract
with Jeong-ha?

53
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,062
<i>Or am I not famous enough for it?</i>

54
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:52,355
If you do <i>Love and Guilt</i>,

55
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:54,148
you'll be famous enough.

56
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:57,443
You're so tenacious.

57
00:04:57,527 --> 00:04:59,403
<i>Should I pick you up?</i>

58
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:01,906
I'll drive. Meet me at the salon.

59
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:07,370
-Grandpa.
-Hey, you're here.

60
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:11,165
I was wondering where you were.

61
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:12,583
I came to exercise.

62
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:15,920
I'll work hard and start
my career as a model, too.

63
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:17,922
Don't overdo it.

64
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:21,968
-I don't want you to faint again.
-It's all right. I have a few tips now.

65
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:28,474
I want you to get more famous
and prove your dad wrong.

66
00:05:28,558 --> 00:05:30,768
He knows nothing about this industry.

67
00:05:42,613 --> 00:05:44,907
Now that he's making some money,
he bought a car.

68
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:48,536
Gosh.

69
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:52,331
-Yeong-nam.
-What brings you here so early?

70
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:55,251
I see. This is the new car Hye-jun bought.

71
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:57,336
What a slick ride.

72
00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:58,671
Gosh.

73
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,342
I was wondering
why you came here this morning.

74
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:05,094
Of course, I'm here for a reason.

75
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,057
I asked you multiple times for Hye-jun's
autographs, but I never got them.

76
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:12,143
-So I came here myself.
-Just for autographs?

77
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:14,145
Exactly. They are just autographs.

78
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:15,354
I'm serious about this.

79
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:18,774
My honor is at stake with dancers
from my belly dance studio.

80
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:21,277
Don't say that in front of him.
He'll think he's famous.

81
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,654
You're starting to worry me.

82
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:26,866
Be nice to him. You'll regret it later.

83
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,827
I won't regret anything.
Don't you worry about me.

84
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:31,495
Are we having guests?

85
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:35,291
Hye-jun!

86
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:38,836
-You startled me.
-She startled me, too.

87
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,630
Hello, sir.

88
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,632
Hye-jun, can we talk?

89
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:45,301
This isn't a good place
for a meet-and-greet.

90
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:50,598
What is this about?

91
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:55,436
You'd better stay sharp.

92
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,648
He's doing that just fine.

93
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:00,775
-You should stay sharp.
-Father.

94
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:02,526
Did you just scold me?

95
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,197
Yes, I did.

96
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,658
You don't get to scold me all the time.

97
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:11,911
Don't you know that Hye-jun is a star now?

98
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:15,706
That makes me a star's grandpa.

99
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:22,755
Gosh.

100
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:27,843
<i>What is it? You're scaring me.</i>

101
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:30,054
<i>Can I ask you out?</i>

102
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:38,229
<i>Can I hit you?</i>

103
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:41,607
Oh, my. I remember you
calling that drama lame.

104
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,567
But you're watching it every day.

105
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:45,278
It wasn't my choice.

106
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:47,697
Why were you watching it then?

107
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,490
It was just on. That's all.

108
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:56,372
<i>-Is that a no?
-Yes, it is.</i>

109
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:03,713
DEPOSIT: 275 MILLION WON

110
00:08:03,796 --> 00:08:05,923
DEPOSIT: 273 MILLION WON

111
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,220
DAD

112
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:14,098
-Dad.
-Did I call too early?

113
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,143
But I didn't want to call you
when you were on the bus.

114
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:18,978
No, this is good.

115
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:21,272
I wake up early these days.
I have a lot to do.

116
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:22,898
What are you doing now?

117
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:26,193
I'm selling my house,
so I'm checking the market.

118
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:27,653
<i>I'm looking for a lot, too.</i>

119
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:29,780
Why would you do that?

120
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:32,074
<i>You don't pay a lot for your mortgage.</i>

121
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:33,909
<i>And what lot?</i>

122
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:35,703
Dad.

123
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:39,790
I find myself in a perplexing phase again.

124
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:43,169
I'm reevaluating my life to see
if I've been doing a good job.

125
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:45,713
Hey, you went through that recently.

126
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,090
So you quit your office job.

127
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:49,550
No.

128
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:52,428
That was a part
of my meticulous ten-year plan.

129
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:55,056
Gosh. We should discuss this in person.

130
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:57,308
Even so, thank you.

131
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,394
What do you mean?

132
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:02,688
<i>For including me in your perplexing phase.</i>

133
00:09:02,772 --> 00:09:04,690
I love being a part of your life.

134
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:07,526
<i>Dad, you should stop
feeling indebted to me.</i>

135
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,571
That's not the right word. It's love.

136
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:13,366
I'll see you in Seoul.

137
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:19,747
WON HAE-HYO

138
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:23,417
<i>I'm filming right now.</i>

139
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:26,295
<i>I'm wearing this
for tomorrow's press conference.</i>

140
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:37,390
THANK YOU, STAFF AND CAST
THIS IS FROM WON HAE-HYO

141
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:40,559
THIS IS FROM WON HAE-HYO

142
00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:00,913
THANK YOU, STAFF AND CAST
THIS IS FROM WON HAE-HYO

143
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,460
Jeez. He's so high-maintenance.

144
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:09,588
Why does he want me
to be at the shoot? Why?

145
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:12,758
I'll let it slide
since he lost a commercial.

146
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:14,427
You haven't told him yet?

147
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,637
No. Another commercial is
under discussion.

148
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,849
If that works out, I'll say the agency
decided to drop the commercial.

149
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:24,812
The studio is planning a press conference,
and they asked us to set aside some time.

150
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,606
We must work around it because
Hye-jun has a tight schedule.

151
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,610
Why is he joining at all?
He has a small role.

152
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:33,863
He's in the limelight these days.

153
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:36,240
The investors are pushing for it.

154
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:38,659
-Don't change Do-ha's schedule.
-Okay.

155
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:42,204
That's some fancy catering.
Who is it from?

156
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:43,747
It's from Hae-hyo.

157
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:47,209
Do you seriously believe
it's from Hae-hyo, Jang-gun?

158
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,547
Didn't you hear Hae-hyo has
rich parents, backing him up?

159
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,633
No, I never heard about it,
but I saw his mom

160
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:58,512
when she came to see you. I saw her, then.

161
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,223
I thought about meeting somewhere else.

162
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:04,560
It's been finalized
that Do-ha will be in <i>Catch</i>.

163
00:11:05,394 --> 00:11:07,021
Hae-hyo also got the script, right?

164
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:11,400
<i>Did you want to show off
your successful transition?</i>

165
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:13,819
I read the script.

166
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:15,988
I also heard
a famous writer will be joining.

167
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:17,823
And a novice writer got bumped down.

168
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:20,576
I'd like to pitch Hae-hyo
for the supporting character.

169
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,578
If you do, will that work?

170
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,331
Yes, but under one condition.

171
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:26,624
I want your apology.

172
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:31,253
Apologize for all of those insults
you threw at me.

173
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:35,424
I don't remember.

174
00:11:35,507 --> 00:11:36,800
What did I exactly say?

175
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:38,219
I'll take that as a no.

176
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:41,222
This is a great opportunity for Hae-hyo.

177
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:44,433
He's the second man
in Superstar Do-ha's movie.

178
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:47,269
After this movie,
Hae-hyo will be offered lead roles.

179
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,939
I can't apologize in advance.

180
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:54,401
But I will apologize once it's finalized
that he gets the role.

181
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:00,699
<i>Things are going well.</i>

182
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:07,498
You look radiant more than usual today.
Hae-hyo's drama is going well. Is that it?

183
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,752
Only two episodes aired,
so it's too early to celebrate.

184
00:12:12,962 --> 00:12:16,757
But I heard scoring 13 percent
for the first episode's ratings is high.

185
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,551
The second episode
bumped up by 1,3 percent, too.

186
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:22,763
Do-ha can't even hold a candle to Hae-hyo.

187
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:26,100
Being your client paid off.
I know you don't say empty compliments.

188
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:28,894
So you know I don't say empty compliments.

189
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,980
Isn't he the main character?

190
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,983
You could say that.
That's a big supporting role.

191
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,110
WON HAE-HYO WANTS YOU

192
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:38,237
I've never had coffee
from my colleague's mom.

193
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:41,448
My mom can be over-the-top.

194
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:43,242
She never listens to me.

195
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:50,040
Do you know
why I pitched you to the director?

196
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:52,001
Why? I was actually very curious.

197
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:54,586
-I want us to be friends.
-Me? Why?

198
00:12:55,337 --> 00:12:56,463
You're a silver spooner.

199
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,008
You're easygoing and classy, too.

200
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:03,178
Silver spooners and dirt spooners.
Must you use such labels?

201
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:05,264
That's the trend these days. Why not?

202
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:09,685
Have you ever felt this?

203
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,022
Worrying about money as a kid.

204
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,858
Worrying your dad might not come home.

205
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:18,485
Worrying your mom might cry.

206
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:25,492
Don't look at me with pity.
Where I am now matters.

207
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:26,452
I'm a star.

208
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,163
But I don't have friends.

209
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:32,458
I don't like Hye-jun
because we were both born poor.

210
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,502
I can see he's tenacious
and full of greed.

211
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:37,296
You're a bit twisted.

212
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:39,757
Being motivated is hard
in tough environments.

213
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,633
He's commendable for staying motivated.

214
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:44,136
In that sense, you are, too.

215
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:46,430
-That's how you became a star.
-What a lecture.

216
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:49,475
Hye-jun is my friend. Don't badmouth him.

217
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:54,229
<i>Min-jae, where are you?
I'm in front of the salon.</i>

218
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:02,488
When you offer her the exclusive contract,
don't mention me.

219
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,616
Say that it was your idea.

220
00:14:08,952 --> 00:14:11,163
No need to rush it.
I want its proper value.

221
00:14:11,997 --> 00:14:14,375
I can only show the house on my days off.

222
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,168
Yes.

223
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:18,462
Okay.

224
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,591
You're selling the house?

225
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:24,510
Yes, I am.

226
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:26,970
Didn't your house represent your life?

227
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:28,222
I had a change of heart.

228
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:31,183
I need money
to set up my own beauty salon.

229
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:32,726
You'll quit the salon?

230
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,396
Isn't that too impulsive?

231
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:38,607
Why would you let Jin-ju's bullying
ruin your life?

232
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:41,443
I'm not ruining my life.
And it's not an impulsive decision.

233
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:45,155
I've been thinking about this and
I made up my mind only recently.

234
00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:49,368
It's hard to come to a decision.
But once I do, I'll take it all the way.

235
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:52,538
Does Hye-jun know?

236
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,709
I want a good relationship for us.

237
00:14:57,668 --> 00:14:59,378
Here's the first rule.

238
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:02,381
Don't ask your significant other
to share your burden.

239
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:07,219
Keep it a secret
until I talk to the director.

240
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:10,055
After taking care of one problem,
I'm going to tell her.

241
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:14,143
SA HYE-JUN AND WON HAE-HYO,
FORMER MODELS DOMINATE THE SHOW BUSINESS

242
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:18,313
Why include Hye-jun in this?
They aren't on the same level.

243
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:20,399
I must go and talk to them.

244
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:24,111
-Are you seeing a reporter?
-Yes.

245
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,488
Hello.

246
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:30,033
It's been a while.
Have you been avoiding me?

247
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:32,786
No. I come and go depending on
my schedule with my clients.

248
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,873
I already washed my hair.

249
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:38,041
-Hye-jun.
-Hello, Ms. Kim.

250
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,626
What a surprise to see you here.

251
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,796
I heard you outperformed
the main character

252
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,882
-and were in the limelight.
-That's not true.

253
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:47,468
I talked to Hae-hyo
after last night's episode.

254
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:48,886
He's filming at a studio set.

255
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:52,097
Yes. You guys haven't been able
to see each other as you're both busy.

256
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:54,725
I'll see him tomorrow
at the press conference.

257
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:57,436
<i>Are they on the same level now?</i>

258
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,354
<i>No, not yet.</i>

259
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,567
I didn't know you were joining.
But don't you have a small role?

260
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,485
How did you know?

261
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:06,904
I read all the scripts Hae-hyo receives.

262
00:16:08,155 --> 00:16:10,532
-Gosh, that's amazing, Ms. Kim.
-I'm so proud of you.

263
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,161
You made it this far without any support
from your family.

264
00:16:14,244 --> 00:16:16,288
It's just for the sake of appearances.

265
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:19,458
This event is for Hae-hyo and Do-ha.
I'll go for moral support.

266
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,423
You're humble, too. Being too humble
isn't a good thing, though.

267
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:27,674
Go ahead.

268
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:30,636
Come over to our house with Jin-u.
I'll order delicious food.

269
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,055
-Okay. See you later.
-Bye.

270
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:41,188
Why didn't you tell me he's a client here?

271
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:44,024
I don't have a big mouth.
I rarely talk about our clients.

272
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:47,027
-Who's his makeup artist?
-Ms. An Jeong-ha.

273
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:50,781
Hae-hyo and Hye-jun have
the same makeup artist.

274
00:16:50,864 --> 00:16:52,783
You don't have to worry.

275
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:56,078
It looks like Hye-jun
has already fallen for Ms. An.

276
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:10,008
Sir, your skin is glowing.

277
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,426
It tickles.

278
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:14,263
This is what I always do, sir.

279
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:17,808
Get some sleep.

280
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:20,102
I'm very sensitive.
I can't fall asleep here.

281
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:23,438
I'm shooting a commercial later.

282
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:25,232
That's not on my schedule.

283
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,987
I guess Min-jae didn't book it yet.

284
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,490
I should cancel my appointment.
I was supposed to meet a manager from MCN.

285
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,742
I see.

286
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,371
Sorry.

287
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:42,082
Why are you sorry?

288
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,085
That's not part of your job.

289
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:48,505
Can I book Ms. An for tomorrow at 8 a.m.?

290
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:52,759
She already has an appointment at 8 a.m.
How about 9 a.m.?

291
00:17:53,343 --> 00:17:54,845
That won't work for us.

292
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:56,638
Can you see if you can change it?

293
00:17:56,722 --> 00:18:00,767
Well, how about Ms. Park Jin-ju?
Just for tomorrow.

294
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:06,023
I don't want to change it
because of scheduling problems.

295
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:09,693
She won't be available unless
Mr. Won Hae-hyo cancels his appointment.

296
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:16,325
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

297
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:24,708
Bye.

298
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,752
-Take care.
-Bye.

299
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:31,089
Who is she?

300
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,220
<i>Parents always rule over their children.</i>

301
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:38,805
<i>My parents ruled over me.</i>

302
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:42,851
<i>And I will rule over my children, too.</i>

303
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,025
I couldn't give birth at the right date
because of my mother-in-law.

304
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:51,777
What kind of path do you see?

305
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:55,489
Creativity rules the modern world.

306
00:18:55,572 --> 00:18:59,993
He will shine more as a celebrity
than as a civil servant.

307
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:05,749
-Hello.
-Hi.

308
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:07,668
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

309
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:09,294
-All right. Sit down.
-Sure.

310
00:19:12,923 --> 00:19:15,592
Among the mock trial topics you sent me,
my favorite was

311
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:17,219
the Deadly Freshmen Orientation.

312
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:20,138
That's my favorite, too.

313
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:22,057
There are precedents, too.

314
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:24,434
What's wrong?

315
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:27,187
This is your mock trial.
And I'm helping you.

316
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,522
What's with your attitude?

317
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:35,153
Ji-a, I did something crazy that day.

318
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:50,711
Aren't you going home?

319
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:52,754
What about you? Why aren't you going home?

320
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:55,590
I'm going to have another drink. Go home.

321
00:19:56,508 --> 00:19:58,051
-Take me home.
-Can't you go alone?

322
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,178
-I want you to take me home.
-No.

323
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:03,390
Call your family. Or call Hae-hyo.

324
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:05,976
He probably gave Ji-a a ride.

325
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,644
Tell him to pick you up here.

326
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:10,439
No. Why are you so mean to me?

327
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:11,523
You…

328
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:17,112
insulted me.

329
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:18,822
-What did I do?
-What did I do?

330
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:20,407
What did I do so terribly wrong?

331
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:23,368
I cherished you with all my heart,

332
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:25,495
so I always put you first
and was considerate.

333
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:27,080
Was that so wrong, too?

334
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:29,541
It's so obvious you're not drunk!

335
00:20:29,624 --> 00:20:32,002
Hey, do you think
I liked everything about you?

336
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:35,672
You are drunk.
Don't say anything that you'll regret.

337
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,215
-Regret, my ass. Damn it.
-"Damn it"?

338
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:38,759
Yes, damn it.

339
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:41,678
I can say it if I want to.
What's wrong with saying that?

340
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:44,097
Get a grip.

341
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:46,183
Do you think I still like you?

342
00:20:55,358 --> 00:20:56,193
What?

343
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:00,322
Do you think your tears

344
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:03,325
will make me feel bad?

345
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:06,203
Do you really not like me anymore?

346
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,790
No, I don't.
I really don't like you anymore.

347
00:21:56,002 --> 00:21:57,045
<i>It sure was a mistake.</i>

348
00:21:57,128 --> 00:22:00,090
Don't let it get too far
and end it though.

349
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:02,884
I hate stories with written endings.

350
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:06,054
I'm done with relationships
that follow written storylines.

351
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:09,349
You'll break up in the end
because you can't handle Jin-u.

352
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:12,018
Even if you can,
your parents won't approve.

353
00:22:12,102 --> 00:22:13,019
Like me and Hye-jun.

354
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:15,772
Who knew you were a coward?

355
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:18,733
I can take on my mom even though
she currently has a hold on me.

356
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:20,861
Taking action is different.

357
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:23,864
But I believe that parents
end up giving in to their children.

358
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:27,534
That's true only for the unprivileged.

359
00:22:27,617 --> 00:22:29,744
It doesn't apply
to kids with rich parents.

360
00:22:30,745 --> 00:22:32,622
When push comes to shove,

361
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:36,793
you'll find out just how strong of a hook
your mom has in your life.

362
00:22:51,766 --> 00:22:53,226
How can you be this handsome?

363
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:55,812
I'm taken aback every single time.

364
00:22:55,896 --> 00:22:57,355
Your head and face…

365
00:22:58,565 --> 00:23:00,817
-They're tiny.
-Stop it, will you?

366
00:23:01,818 --> 00:23:04,029
Don't you have any complaints?
"Where's my van?"

367
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:05,989
"Until when must I drive?"

368
00:23:06,072 --> 00:23:08,033
Above everything, you're patient too.

369
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:09,284
You're terribly stubborn.

370
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:11,578
So are you.

371
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,124
You'll be meeting the director
of <i>The King Returns</i>.

372
00:23:19,544 --> 00:23:21,296
And Jeong-ha isn't needed for the ad.

373
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:23,715
The ad agency designates stylists for you.

374
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:25,175
Can I still eat with her?

375
00:23:33,224 --> 00:23:34,643
The <i>jjajangmyeon</i> is awesome.

376
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:36,561
It's too bad you had to pass.

377
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:37,938
<i>Jjamppong</i> is way better.

378
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:39,898
No, <i>jjajangmyeon</i> trumps.

379
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:43,151
Have you no love for your agency?

380
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:44,277
It's <i>jjamppong</i> for us.

381
00:23:44,361 --> 00:23:46,196
It's your company, not mine.

382
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:48,573
For me, it's <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

383
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:52,160
Jeez.

384
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:00,752
Hey!

385
00:24:00,835 --> 00:24:02,963
Must you rub it in my face like that?

386
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:04,798
What did we do?

387
00:24:08,134 --> 00:24:09,552
Jeong-ha,

388
00:24:09,636 --> 00:24:12,681
what do you think about being
Hye-jun's personal makeup artist?

389
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:18,311
It's my idea, not his.

390
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,482
It's not something I can decide on my own.

391
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:25,026
Besides, I'm exclusive to Hae-hyo.

392
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,237
I would need his permission too.

393
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,824
Your status at the salon will rise
if you agree to it.

394
00:24:31,783 --> 00:24:33,368
The situation is complicated.

395
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:35,495
Well, I should get going.

396
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:37,789
You'll soon make it big as a YouTuber.

397
00:24:37,872 --> 00:24:39,958
I haven't even decided on
changing my career.

398
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:42,836
Let me know how things go.

399
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:45,171
-Sure. Enjoy your meal.
-See you around.

400
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:49,801
Is she quitting the salon?

401
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,429
-I don't know.
-Shouldn't you?

402
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:56,182
My Jeong-ha will tell me
if it's something I should know.

403
00:24:57,976 --> 00:25:01,354
She's not like someone I know
who goes off the grid when cornered.

404
00:25:03,231 --> 00:25:05,025
Until when will you tease me for that?

405
00:25:05,108 --> 00:25:06,609
Until you marry.

406
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:09,195
That means you'll tease me forever!

407
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,613
How dare you--

408
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:12,824
Are you saying you'll never marry?

409
00:25:12,907 --> 00:25:14,075
You jerk.

410
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:19,164
-Hello.
-Hello.

411
00:25:20,457 --> 00:25:21,583
Welcome.

412
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,793
The studio you'll work in…

413
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,047
I mean, the one you might work in.

414
00:25:27,714 --> 00:25:29,883
Let me show you the studio. It's this way.

415
00:25:29,966 --> 00:25:31,217
Thank you.

416
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:35,847
A one-man YouTuber is impossible.
No one works alone these days.

417
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,351
-Let's raise the key.
-Sure.

418
00:25:42,312 --> 00:25:44,564
Let me take a bite. Hold it like this.

419
00:25:44,647 --> 00:25:46,357
This is how you eat.

420
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:49,027
Here you go.

421
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:56,659
From gaining subscribers

422
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,246
to developing contents,
we'll help you in every way.

423
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,041
Gaining subscribers isn't easy, you know.

424
00:26:03,124 --> 00:26:04,209
It requires a strategy.

425
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:08,254
Even now, countless people
knock on the YouTube business

426
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,341
because they think that yapping in a video

427
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,177
automatically fattens their bank accounts.

428
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:19,682
You're awfully quiet though.

429
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:21,851
Any questions?

430
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:28,608
It's not at all like how I have imagined.

431
00:26:32,612 --> 00:26:34,114
Are you off to see a client?

432
00:26:35,281 --> 00:26:37,242
You must've come in for one.

433
00:26:39,828 --> 00:26:43,248
I decided not to hate you.

434
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:44,707
It's a waste of my emotions.

435
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:46,960
So instead, help me leave this salon.

436
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:49,879
How?

437
00:26:49,963 --> 00:26:51,673
Apologize to me in front of everyone.

438
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:54,717
Let them know that they're wrong about me.

439
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:01,474
That's worse than
you splashing water on me.

440
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:03,685
I won't do it.

441
00:27:03,768 --> 00:27:06,229
Since you want to leave,
I want you to stay.

442
00:27:07,522 --> 00:27:08,857
I can take it, you know.

443
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:20,785
SU-BIN

444
00:27:22,912 --> 00:27:25,039
<i>I hope this can be of help.</i>

446
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,135
Take off the sunglasses
when you reach the spot,

447
00:27:37,218 --> 00:27:39,721
hang them from the shirt pocket, and halt.

448
00:27:42,307 --> 00:27:44,392
Please keep in mind that all the moves

449
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:46,519
must be done with fluidity as you walk.

450
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,188
-Let's try again.
-Right.

451
00:27:50,815 --> 00:27:52,275
You'll lose your pace

452
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:55,361
if you look down as you
hang the sunglasses from your pocket.

453
00:28:04,537 --> 00:28:06,915
That's what I warned you about
seconds ago.

454
00:28:08,124 --> 00:28:09,751
My walk was fine the other day.

455
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:12,378
Keeping your balance
when walking is key, Mr. Sa.

456
00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:14,088
I see.

457
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:15,632
Let's talk later.

458
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:17,258
What?

459
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,387
-It was fun today.
-I'm sure it's nothing.

460
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,473
It's not like she'll kick you out.

461
00:28:24,057 --> 00:28:26,851
You have a smart way
rubbing it in, don't you?

462
00:28:27,477 --> 00:28:29,229
I am clever, for that matter.

463
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:31,231
I graduated from a nice college.

464
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:34,067
-Anyway, I'll wait for you here.
-Don't.

465
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,235
-Just go.
-But…

466
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:37,153
Darn it.

467
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:45,703
Who took these photos?

468
00:28:45,787 --> 00:28:47,539
My grandson's friend.

469
00:28:48,414 --> 00:28:49,832
-Are they bad?
-Of course not.

470
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:53,419
I only asked because
I sense love in the photos.

471
00:28:53,503 --> 00:28:56,923
So that's why you asked to see me today.

472
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:00,885
Then I'll get going.

473
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:02,428
No, wait.

474
00:29:03,846 --> 00:29:06,099
Have you heard of Premium Silver Village?

475
00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:08,685
Pre… What?

476
00:29:09,477 --> 00:29:10,311
What's that?

477
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:11,938
A high-end nursing home.

478
00:29:12,564 --> 00:29:15,233
<i>Why the hell is she bringing this up?</i>

479
00:29:15,316 --> 00:29:17,860
<i>Does she receive a cut
for connecting new residents?</i>

480
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:21,281
I have no money for a room there.

481
00:29:22,532 --> 00:29:25,201
Gosh, no. That's not it.

482
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:28,246
You've been hired to be in its print ad.

483
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,040
Me?

484
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:34,460
Even as a model,
I always wanted to be an actor.

485
00:29:34,544 --> 00:29:37,213
It was my major
although I quit in my freshman year.

486
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:38,840
Being in <i>Love and Guilt</i> will

487
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:40,717
definitely make you a household name.

488
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:44,470
You're lucky to have
your next project be of a top writer's.

489
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,561
Are you turning it down?

490
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:54,814
My next project is my choice.

491
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:56,899
And whatever happens is my responsibility.

492
00:29:58,026 --> 00:30:00,820
That's a smart answer.
So you'll be passing.

493
00:30:00,903 --> 00:30:02,697
Were you even offered a part?

494
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,991
That'll conclude the interview, right?

495
00:30:06,993 --> 00:30:08,745
-You move fast, Ms. Lee.
-Right.

496
00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:12,206
Lastly, what kind of an actor
do you wish to be?

497
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:17,920
Someone of this era
who people can relate to

498
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:19,964
and find comfort in.

499
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:21,716
That's a heart-warming answer,

500
00:30:23,926 --> 00:30:25,553
but nothing like who you are.

501
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:29,932
No, that's exactly how he's like.

502
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:32,477
-It's over now, right?
-Sure.

503
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:34,562
Thank you for today.

504
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:36,064
Thank you.

505
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:38,816
GRANDPA

506
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:41,736
-May I take this call?
-Sure.

507
00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:47,075
-Thank you for today.
-Grandpa.

508
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:50,703
What is it?

509
00:30:53,623 --> 00:30:55,792
Really? Congratulations.

510
00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:00,463
-Ms. Lee.
-Yes?

511
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:04,050
Do you know Mr. Lee Tae-su?

512
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:11,724
Did he perhaps mention me to you?

513
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:14,143
No.

514
00:31:15,895 --> 00:31:17,855
I'd rather keep my mouth shut.

515
00:31:17,939 --> 00:31:19,941
Normally people say that

516
00:31:20,775 --> 00:31:22,568
where they actually have a lot to say

517
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:24,070
or nothing to say at all.

518
00:31:24,153 --> 00:31:26,322
Or when refraining oneself from swearing.

519
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:31,911
It doesn't mean that
I want to speak ill of him or anything.

520
00:31:31,994 --> 00:31:35,039
I just added my opinion to your assessment

521
00:31:35,123 --> 00:31:38,751
regrading the phrase "I'd rather keep
my mouth shut."

522
00:31:40,837 --> 00:31:42,130
I see you're quite humorous.

523
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,923
I'm glad you think so.

524
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:46,300
I hope Hye-jun made a good impression.

525
00:31:48,845 --> 00:31:50,304
Let me clean this up for you.

526
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:54,600
Have a good day then. Thank you.

527
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:01,441
-Mr. Sa.
-Yes?

528
00:32:01,524 --> 00:32:04,819
Could I have Wooshin Company's
loan application and financial statements?

529
00:32:04,902 --> 00:32:05,862
Just a moment.

530
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:08,322
-Please take your time.
-Right.

531
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:14,537
Which series will he join next?

532
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,414
-I don't know.
-How so?

533
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:22,253
Brothers rarely tell each other things.

534
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:24,464
Oh, I see.

535
00:32:25,673 --> 00:32:27,049
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

536
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:31,345
Won't he come by for dinner again?

537
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:35,308
-Should I invite him?
-Yes. It'll be on me.

538
00:32:36,684 --> 00:32:38,770
Can I not come to the office
this weekend then?

539
00:32:38,853 --> 00:32:40,938
It isn't even my shift.

540
00:32:42,106 --> 00:32:45,151
Sure, stay home and rest.
All the more work for me, I guess.

541
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:46,277
Thank you.

542
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:48,654
Can you get me his autograph?

543
00:32:48,738 --> 00:32:50,698
This makes me uncomfortable, you know.

544
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:52,325
This isn't professional of you.

545
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:55,661
I thought it was on mute.

546
00:32:55,745 --> 00:32:57,371
Mr. Sa, are you kidding me?

547
00:32:57,455 --> 00:32:59,832
-No calls during work--
-I'll get the autograph.

548
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:02,960
It seems urgent, so go ahead.

549
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:05,296
-Make sure to keep it on mute though.
-Yes, ma'am.

550
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:07,173
I apologize.

551
00:33:10,092 --> 00:33:11,594
I hate asking him for favors.

552
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,183
MY FAMILY

553
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:19,769
<i>Grandpa has an announcement,
so don't be late.</i>

554
00:33:19,852 --> 00:33:22,396
<i>-What announcement?
-Will you be home early too?</i>

555
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,982
-<i>No, I have a commercial to film.</i>
-A commercial?

556
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:28,778
<i>What commercial?</i>

557
00:33:30,905 --> 00:33:31,864
<i>I'll tell you later.</i>

558
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:33,658
Why won't he tell us what's it about?

559
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:35,701
Is Hye-jun filming something?

560
00:33:36,202 --> 00:33:37,370
A commercial.

561
00:33:38,204 --> 00:33:39,205
Good for him.

562
00:33:39,872 --> 00:33:41,791
You might be a billionaire soon, you know.

563
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:45,253
-Unbelievable.
-Top celebrities easily buy buildings

564
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:47,296
and turn their lives around.

565
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,006
Don't you be like this either.

566
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,424
That only happens to people

567
00:33:50,508 --> 00:33:53,261
who saved their countries
ten times in their previous lives.

568
00:33:56,222 --> 00:33:57,723
Anyway, what's up with my father?

569
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:04,272
Jeez, I'm so exhausted.

570
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:19,078
I saw Hye-jun and his girlfriend today.

571
00:34:19,954 --> 00:34:21,622
Both of them? In a formal setting?

572
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:24,125
She's the makeup artist
at my regular salon.

573
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,543
Hye-jun goes there too.

574
00:34:26,127 --> 00:34:28,671
I didn't know you go there too, Ms. Kim.

575
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:31,090
<i>You never call me "ma'am," do you?</i>

576
00:34:31,173 --> 00:34:33,759
<i>It's not like I want you too though.</i>

577
00:34:33,843 --> 00:34:35,970
He said he'd introduce me to her soon.

578
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:40,349
She's smart and is good at what she does.

579
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:43,227
I think she's sweet,
but I don't know how you'd think.

580
00:34:44,312 --> 00:34:45,897
Only their feelings matter.

581
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,941
One's feelings are the easiest to change.

582
00:34:49,025 --> 00:34:51,319
Being on good terms now
doesn't guarantee anything.

583
00:34:51,402 --> 00:34:53,821
Hye-jun is
at a crucial moment in his life.

584
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:57,241
He could become even popular, so
news about him dating someone won't help.

585
00:34:57,325 --> 00:34:59,035
I'm sure he has it handled.

586
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:00,870
Why bother being a parent

587
00:35:00,953 --> 00:35:03,372
if you're not going
to interfere in their lives?

588
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:07,043
<i>Lecturing me on parenting
has become a routine of hers.</i>

589
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:10,212
<i>She thinks it'll bring
Hye-jun up to Hae-hyo's level.</i>

590
00:35:12,298 --> 00:35:15,259
Parents exist to be a shade in the sun.

591
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:18,304
<i>You never take my advice, do you?</i>

592
00:35:18,387 --> 00:35:20,056
<i>It's why there's never any progress.</i>

593
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,476
We come from completely different worlds

594
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,978
and have separate views
regarding our lives.

595
00:35:26,062 --> 00:35:28,022
Understanding each other seems impossible.

596
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:30,816
<i>You're figuring that out just now?</i>

597
00:35:37,406 --> 00:35:39,033
SIDE DISHES

598
00:35:39,116 --> 00:35:40,159
Yes?

599
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:44,789
I don't know which olive oil to buy.
I'll get the most expensive one.

600
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:49,251
There's one that's most compatible
when making <i>gambas al ajillo</i>.

601
00:35:49,335 --> 00:35:50,544
Then what?

602
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:54,340
Fine, I'll buy it instead.

603
00:35:54,423 --> 00:35:56,217
Sure. That'll be better for us.

604
00:35:58,302 --> 00:35:59,887
Unbelievable.

605
00:36:00,596 --> 00:36:02,181
Jin-u's mom is a good cook,

606
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:05,017
but she gets on my nerves.

607
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:07,853
Are you talking behind her back?

608
00:36:07,937 --> 00:36:10,648
We're close friends,
so don't expect me to chime in.

609
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,569
That's kind of upsetting.
Aren't we close too?

610
00:36:19,323 --> 00:36:20,491
Well…

611
00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:21,993
Well, what?

612
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,455
Jin-u's mom is like that at times.

613
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:31,252
It's because
she's generous and kind-hearted.

614
00:36:31,961 --> 00:36:34,046
Having her as a friend is the best.

615
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,548
She'll always take your side.

616
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:42,888
I'm hungry!

617
00:36:44,015 --> 00:36:45,266
You're home early.

618
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:48,686
Aren't any of your friends free
to join you for drinks tonight?

619
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:50,980
Hye-jun and Hae-hyo's careers
are on the rise.

620
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:53,357
When will the <i>galbijjim</i> be ready?

621
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:55,234
It's for Hae-hyo's family, not ours.

622
00:36:55,317 --> 00:36:57,111
I make side dishes for them now.

623
00:36:57,987 --> 00:36:58,988
Since when?

624
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,198
Did you meet with his mom then?

625
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:03,492
-Of course.
-Why would you work for her?

626
00:37:04,785 --> 00:37:06,287
Well, she's bored.

627
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,955
You should've stopped her!

628
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:10,708
Well, I…

629
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:14,795
I'm against this.

630
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:17,173
-So?
-Let's have <i>galbijjim</i>, too.

631
00:37:17,256 --> 00:37:19,967
Sounds good.
I'll make some for Hye-jun too.

632
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:22,762
Where are you going?

633
00:37:38,444 --> 00:37:40,613
Will Hye-jun be late
because of this commercial?

634
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:42,364
He was vague in his text.

635
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,784
Did you know about his commercial?

636
00:37:44,867 --> 00:37:46,285
I didn't.

637
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,623
I get why I didn't know,
but shouldn't you be more attentive?

638
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,668
That comment is slightly upsetting.

639
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:57,213
Are you holding me
by a different standard?

640
00:37:57,296 --> 00:37:59,256
You're being overly sensitive again.

641
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,634
This is our son.
And it's natural to be sensitive.

642
00:38:03,302 --> 00:38:05,179
I hear about Hye-jun from Hae-hyo's mom.

643
00:38:06,138 --> 00:38:09,266
I've tried to raise my kids
to be responsible and independent,

644
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,185
so I hate coming across as inattentive.

645
00:38:11,268 --> 00:38:12,978
Unlike you, I never got in their way.

646
00:38:13,062 --> 00:38:16,690
Just forget it.
Bringing it up only makes me the bad guy.

647
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:26,367
You…

648
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,079
You're home late.

649
00:38:30,162 --> 00:38:32,248
I came as fast as I could for Grandpa.

650
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:34,333
-Is Hye-jun home?
-Yes, Mom.

651
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:35,918
-Have you had dinner?
-Yes.

652
00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:38,796
So this is how you look on set.

653
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:41,507
-You're so handsome.
-I'm your son, aren't I?

654
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:44,426
Hye-jun…

655
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:47,221
-Can we talk?
-Let me wash up first.

656
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:54,937
-He looks like a celebrity.
-He is.

657
00:38:57,898 --> 00:39:01,735
I wonder what it is
that Father needs to tell us about.

658
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:14,331
Hye-jun, come over here.

659
00:39:18,794 --> 00:39:22,506
I wanted to earn money
so that I could treat the family.

660
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:25,801
But you haven't yet.

661
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:28,762
I'll treat them to even something better
when I do.

662
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:30,472
This is 70,000 won.

663
00:39:30,556 --> 00:39:32,266
I saved the money you gave me.

664
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:40,065
Fine. I'm glad that my mentoring paid off.

665
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:42,026
Good.

666
00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:45,654
<i>Father, did you order pizza?</i>

667
00:39:46,363 --> 00:39:48,282
It's here. Let's go.

668
00:39:55,247 --> 00:39:56,498
It didn't take long.

669
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:58,584
Thank you!

670
00:40:02,963 --> 00:40:04,757
It's on me today.

671
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,383
-Sure.
-Enjoy, Grandpa.

672
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:07,676
It's good.

673
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,679
Are you seriously eating
when I've yet to take a bite?

674
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:12,097
When did we ever bother?

675
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:13,474
How about we start today?

676
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:16,018
Fine. Go ahead then.

677
00:40:17,686 --> 00:40:20,481
All right. Everyone, let's eat.

678
00:40:20,564 --> 00:40:22,191
-Sure.
-Got it.

679
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:33,160
It's good.

680
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:36,080
Father, please tell us now.

681
00:40:36,914 --> 00:40:39,750
I've been chosen for an advertisement.

682
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:47,424
-Are you sure it's not a scam?
-No. I thought so too,

683
00:40:47,508 --> 00:40:50,010
so I asked the instructor
if I had to pay money.

684
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:51,553
As if she'd be honest.

685
00:40:51,637 --> 00:40:54,014
That's how they hook you at the beginning.

686
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:56,141
It's a well-rated academy

687
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:58,394
which also serves as a modeling agency.

688
00:40:58,477 --> 00:41:00,020
Not everything's a scam, you know.

689
00:41:00,604 --> 00:41:03,482
After seeing the photos
that Jin-u took of me,

690
00:41:03,565 --> 00:41:06,360
everyone's been gushing over

691
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:08,237
how good I look.

692
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:10,197
So…

693
00:41:11,865 --> 00:41:14,868
It's not my own opinion.
The people at the ad agency said it.

694
00:41:15,411 --> 00:41:16,370
Congratulations.

695
00:41:16,453 --> 00:41:19,248
Right. Well, I owe it all…

696
00:41:20,249 --> 00:41:21,667
to Hye-jun.

697
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:25,004
Let's just wait until you get paid, Dad.

698
00:41:25,587 --> 00:41:27,548
Hye-jun's showed you how it can go south.

699
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:30,509
Nothing's a given
when it comes to this industry.

700
00:41:30,592 --> 00:41:32,636
It doesn't hurt
to be happy about it though.

701
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,096
Even if it does go south,

702
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:36,432
what matters is that
I was considered for the job.

703
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:38,517
Who paid for the pizza?

704
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,853
You wouldn't know how,
so it must've been Hye-jun.

705
00:41:40,936 --> 00:41:44,481
He paid for your lessons
and bought pizza to please you.

706
00:41:44,565 --> 00:41:46,650
You're not his son, you know.

707
00:41:46,734 --> 00:41:49,945
You should be the one encouraging him,
not the other way around.

708
00:41:52,906 --> 00:41:54,450
Father…

709
00:41:55,075 --> 00:41:58,078
Why are you crying?
Now I look like a jerk.

710
00:41:58,162 --> 00:41:59,371
This is a reality check.

711
00:41:59,455 --> 00:42:01,206
You're not a jerk at all.

712
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:06,003
With old age,

713
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,130
tears easily form.

714
00:42:10,132 --> 00:42:12,634
He gave me money for the pizza.
70,000 won.

715
00:42:13,385 --> 00:42:16,096
You, as my dad,
have never encouraged me once.

716
00:42:17,514 --> 00:42:19,725
You've never supported the things I do.

717
00:42:20,642 --> 00:42:23,354
It was only to guide you
down the right path.

718
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:27,524
Am I a joke to you
now that you're a hotshot?

719
00:42:28,942 --> 00:42:30,778
Why on earth is that your response?

720
00:42:31,987 --> 00:42:33,530
Just answer my question.

721
00:42:33,614 --> 00:42:36,241
Have you ever supported
anything I've done?

722
00:42:36,325 --> 00:42:39,161
There are a number of ways
for one to support another.

723
00:42:39,244 --> 00:42:40,496
Some are strict like Dad

724
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:43,499
while some show encouragement
from within like me.

725
00:42:43,582 --> 00:42:45,626
You have no right to undermine us.

726
00:42:46,126 --> 00:42:47,711
You're one to talk.

727
00:42:48,212 --> 00:42:50,672
None of it matters
unless the support is visible.

728
00:42:51,965 --> 00:42:53,926
Nicely put, Hye-jun.

729
00:42:54,009 --> 00:42:55,969
It's only encouragement when shown.

730
00:42:57,805 --> 00:42:59,515
-Let's head inside.
-Yes, let's.

731
00:42:59,598 --> 00:43:02,768
Come on. We aren't a bunch of kids,

732
00:43:02,851 --> 00:43:04,978
so why must it always end this way?

733
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:06,814
I'll say it again.

734
00:43:07,314 --> 00:43:09,400
The support that is never shown

735
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:12,277
means nothing.

736
00:43:12,361 --> 00:43:13,612
Nothing at all!

737
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,281
Father.

738
00:43:16,365 --> 00:43:17,741
Come on.

739
00:43:22,663 --> 00:43:23,872
Why stay silent?

740
00:43:23,956 --> 00:43:25,040
Say something cool!

741
00:43:25,124 --> 00:43:28,460
When you said he thinks you're a joke
now that he's a hotshot,

742
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:29,878
you already lost.

743
00:43:29,962 --> 00:43:33,006
What's the point of talking about
losing or winning? We're a family.

744
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:09,751
"Everything is a complete mess,

745
00:44:11,128 --> 00:44:12,671
but I am happy."

746
00:44:12,754 --> 00:44:14,631
I shall say that to brainwash myself.

747
00:44:29,062 --> 00:44:30,355
Would he be asleep now?

748
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,058
JEONG-HA

749
00:45:06,141 --> 00:45:07,392
<i>Can you talk on the phone now?</i>

750
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:17,319
<i>Did everything go well at MCN?</i>

751
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:19,154
<i>I can't really talk now.</i>

752
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:33,835
<i>I like to make someone shine.</i>

753
00:45:35,712 --> 00:45:37,464
<i>Here goes your "I Like" series.</i>

754
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:40,050
<i>You were born to be a makeup artist.</i>

755
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:45,013
<i>That's right.
And you were born to be a star.</i>

756
00:45:45,097 --> 00:45:47,891
<i>You sparkle so radiantly
even when you're not doing anything.</i>

757
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:51,478
<i>You're such a sweet talker.</i>

758
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:53,272
<i>What are you up to now?</i>

759
00:45:54,273 --> 00:45:56,149
<i>Just having some beer. What about you?</i>

760
00:45:56,733 --> 00:45:58,402
<i>I'm texting with you.</i>

761
00:45:59,444 --> 00:46:02,864
<i>You must be happy. I'm sure you're
totally focused on what you're doing now.</i>

762
00:46:11,832 --> 00:46:13,333
<i>Yes, I am happy.</i>

763
00:46:14,293 --> 00:46:15,419
<i>Is it me or the beer?</i>

764
00:46:36,718 --> 00:46:37,760
He's not out yet.

765
00:46:45,601 --> 00:46:46,894
Ta-da.

766
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:50,356
Meet No. 1. It'll take you everywhere
from now on, Superstar Sa.

767
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,024
It has a name? What does it mean?

768
00:46:52,108 --> 00:46:54,026
One, as in one, two, three.
Your first car.

769
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:57,655
Let's go, No. 1.

770
00:46:57,739 --> 00:46:58,740
Wait!

771
00:47:12,044 --> 00:47:13,212
That's my dad.

772
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:16,215
Hello, I'm Hye-jun's manager.

773
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,886
I'll introduce myself to you properly
another time.

774
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:21,429
Oh, sure.

775
00:47:29,228 --> 00:47:31,481
Dad, Mom's saying breakfast is ready.

776
00:47:41,282 --> 00:47:42,241
Who's that?

777
00:47:43,075 --> 00:47:44,577
Hye-jun's manager is a woman.

778
00:47:45,578 --> 00:47:47,205
And she's a good driver.

779
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,043
AN ABNORMAL MAN WHO WANTS TO BE NORMAL

780
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:27,870
<i>Normal Person</i> is a story about people who

781
00:48:27,954 --> 00:48:30,414
never wanted to be normal
coming to desire normalcy.

782
00:48:30,498 --> 00:48:33,251
Our superstar, Park Do-ha,
met his character,

783
00:48:33,334 --> 00:48:37,129
who is an ordinary guy,
which made the story even more special.

784
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:40,633
Do-ha, you play the lead,
but you were beaten to a pulp.

785
00:48:40,716 --> 00:48:42,385
Gosh, that was hard.

786
00:48:42,885 --> 00:48:44,679
Hye-jun is a hard puncher.

787
00:48:44,762 --> 00:48:48,850
Oh, I'm just realizing now
that the three of you are the same age.

788
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:50,726
That's why we had so much fun on set.

789
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,813
Hae-hyo and I are actually filming
the same drama at the moment.

790
00:48:53,896 --> 00:48:56,399
My gosh!
That explains the amazing teamwork.

791
00:48:58,025 --> 00:49:01,195
Hye-jun, why are you so quiet?

792
00:49:01,696 --> 00:49:05,783
How did you play that ruthless character
with such a kind, sweet face?

793
00:49:05,867 --> 00:49:06,993
Thank you.

794
00:49:07,535 --> 00:49:10,872
Being able to take part in a movie
by Director Choi, whom I deeply admire,

795
00:49:10,955 --> 00:49:13,165
was a huge honor to me in itself.

796
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:16,502
Since I didn't want to disgrace
his name or the movie,

797
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:20,047
I poured all my energy into it. So now,
I don't really have anything to say.

798
00:49:21,257 --> 00:49:23,801
My gosh, this reminds me of

799
00:49:23,885 --> 00:49:27,013
<i>Gateway</i>!

800
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:32,810
Oh, my. Hold on.

801
00:49:32,894 --> 00:49:34,812
This isn't part of the script,

802
00:49:34,896 --> 00:49:36,939
but I'm going to get up for a second.

803
00:49:37,857 --> 00:49:39,233
I'm coming over.

804
00:49:42,069 --> 00:49:44,906
Can I ask you to do something for me?

805
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:47,074
I really wanted to hear it in real life.

806
00:49:47,158 --> 00:49:49,160
Can you say, "Can I ask you out?"

807
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:57,209
Just once, please.

808
00:50:07,553 --> 00:50:08,679
Can I ask you out?

809
00:50:11,933 --> 00:50:14,936
Yes, of course, you can.
Can I ask you out, too?

810
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:15,853
Thank you.

811
00:50:15,937 --> 00:50:17,855
Oh, my heart. I need to calm down.

812
00:50:17,939 --> 00:50:20,024
Calm down, my heart.

813
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:39,168
You're so well-spoken.

814
00:50:39,251 --> 00:50:40,586
No, I'm not.

815
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,883
-Sa Hye-jun?
-Yes, over here.

816
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:47,051
Please leave it here.

817
00:50:47,134 --> 00:50:48,970
-Have a good day.
-Thank you.

818
00:50:49,053 --> 00:50:50,262
What is this?

819
00:50:50,346 --> 00:50:52,264
The beauty brand sent this for you.

820
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:54,642
Wait, aren't I their model?

821
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,151
Congratulations on getting this.

822
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:05,611
I know, thanks.

823
00:51:07,196 --> 00:51:08,572
And a cell phone ad too?

824
00:51:08,656 --> 00:51:11,367
These aren't the only ads. He's been busy.

825
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:12,535
Here, look.

826
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,161
What is this?

827
00:51:14,245 --> 00:51:16,539
Rom-coms always bring in more ads.

828
00:51:16,622 --> 00:51:18,249
I want to be lucky like you.

829
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:20,918
I want to hang out, but I have a shoot.

830
00:51:21,002 --> 00:51:24,005
Hey, he's busy too.
He has a meeting with a director.

831
00:51:24,088 --> 00:51:26,257
-It's for my next drama.
-<i>The King Returns</i>.

832
00:51:26,841 --> 00:51:29,176
-You already know?
-Of course, she knows.

833
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,594
You prick…

834
00:51:30,678 --> 00:51:32,263
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Hey.

835
00:51:32,346 --> 00:51:33,389
-Guys.
-Get off of him.

836
00:51:33,472 --> 00:51:34,598
-Hey.
-Look at you.

837
00:51:38,936 --> 00:51:39,979
Hello.

838
00:51:42,481 --> 00:51:43,858
You did well.

839
00:51:43,941 --> 00:51:45,693
What? You just got here.

840
00:51:45,776 --> 00:51:47,611
No, I got here a while ago.

841
00:51:47,695 --> 00:51:50,573
-I saw the whole thing.
-Do you not care about me at all?

842
00:51:50,656 --> 00:51:53,034
Everything I do is for you.

843
00:51:53,117 --> 00:51:55,286
Oh, is that so?

844
00:51:55,953 --> 00:51:57,204
Look at that.

845
00:52:02,543 --> 00:52:04,795
-This is so cool.
-Is it?

846
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:14,221
How could we lose the ad contract
to Hye-jun?

847
00:52:14,305 --> 00:52:15,890
-Why didn't you tell me?
-If I did,

848
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:20,352
would anything change?
You're still so full of yourself.

849
00:52:20,436 --> 00:52:22,688
-What?
-You soared to the top years ago.

850
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,523
Frankly, you're going downhill.

851
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:27,151
I'd say even just maintaining this
is a job well done.

852
00:52:30,196 --> 00:52:31,989
Hey, you're talking to Park Do-ha here.

853
00:52:32,073 --> 00:52:34,241
And you are my manager.

854
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:36,243
What is with you?
Are you lecturing me now?

855
00:52:36,327 --> 00:52:37,828
Yes, I am!

856
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,167
We've worked together
for about a year now,

857
00:52:43,751 --> 00:52:45,294
so we know a lot about each other.

858
00:52:45,377 --> 00:52:47,713
Like our strengths, weaknesses,
and shortcomings!

859
00:52:50,007 --> 00:52:51,467
Just trust me, okay?

860
00:52:52,176 --> 00:52:53,969
No one cares about you more than I do.

861
00:52:54,678 --> 00:52:55,930
I have to, for my own sake.

862
00:52:56,013 --> 00:52:58,182
I benefit from your success.

863
00:52:58,265 --> 00:53:00,893
You're such a brat,
so I want to just beat you up at times,

864
00:53:00,976 --> 00:53:04,188
but I don't. I try very hard
to be patient around you.

865
00:53:05,981 --> 00:53:07,775
So you should also learn to be patient.

866
00:53:13,072 --> 00:53:15,658
What… What are my shortcomings?

867
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:20,037
All you have to do
is just keep living this way.

868
00:53:25,209 --> 00:53:27,503
Okay. I'll trust you
and keep living this way.

869
00:53:27,586 --> 00:53:30,256
However, I cannot let Hye-jun beat me.

870
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:34,176
You said you care about me.
Then what can you do for me?

871
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:02,181
Do not get in my way.

872
00:55:02,264 --> 00:55:03,641
I will spare your life.

873
00:55:03,724 --> 00:55:06,101
Those who have lived too long
tend to talk rubbish.

874
00:55:14,735 --> 00:55:15,611
Let us handle this.

875
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:18,239
Go with your brother, Your Highness.

876
00:55:18,322 --> 00:55:20,324
Spare his life if he begs for mercy.

877
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,209
Well done.

878
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:32,253
Thank you.

879
00:55:33,087 --> 00:55:34,046
-Here.
-Was that okay?

880
00:55:34,129 --> 00:55:35,839
It was awesome. Do you want to see?

881
00:55:37,258 --> 00:55:38,175
Here, look.

882
00:55:43,472 --> 00:55:45,224
The call time for tomorrow is 5 a.m.

883
00:55:45,307 --> 00:55:47,559
-We'll send you the details. Thank you!
-Got it.

884
00:55:47,643 --> 00:55:48,769
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

885
00:55:48,852 --> 00:55:50,354
Thank you for everything.

886
00:55:51,438 --> 00:55:54,775
If the call time is 5 a.m.,
shall we sleep somewhere around here?

887
00:55:54,858 --> 00:55:56,068
Yes, that'd be better.

888
00:55:56,151 --> 00:55:57,152
All right.

889
00:55:57,236 --> 00:55:59,029
-Hey, I was so surprised earlier.
-Why?

890
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:02,783
I wish you were here
to admire this sky with me.

891
00:56:04,702 --> 00:56:06,161
I'll bring you here sometime.

892
00:56:06,245 --> 00:56:07,246
<i>Sure.</i>

893
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,665
I'm off tomorrow,

894
00:56:09,748 --> 00:56:11,458
but no one is coming to see my place.

895
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:14,503
<i>I should go talk to the realtor.</i>

896
00:56:14,586 --> 00:56:17,089
If I offered help, would you accept it?

897
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:19,425
I'd say no, even to my dad.

898
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,053
Can I go to sleep now?

899
00:56:23,971 --> 00:56:26,015
How could you get sleepy
while talking to me?

900
00:56:28,517 --> 00:56:30,227
I'm really tired.

901
00:56:30,769 --> 00:56:33,564
I've been looking at commercial spaces
whenever I have time.

902
00:56:34,315 --> 00:56:36,233
But the ones that I like
are all expensive.

903
00:56:37,776 --> 00:56:41,447
<i>Sorry I can't enjoy
this romantic moment with you.</i>

904
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:43,490
Sweet dreams.

905
00:57:34,249 --> 00:57:36,335
-Hello.
-Hello.

906
00:57:37,002 --> 00:57:39,380
I've listed my place for sale.

907
00:57:39,463 --> 00:57:41,131
How come no one's coming to see it?

908
00:57:41,215 --> 00:57:43,717
Your father took the listing
off the market.

909
00:57:44,468 --> 00:57:47,513
What?
You should have checked with me first.

910
00:57:47,596 --> 00:57:48,972
But do you think it will sell?

911
00:57:49,056 --> 00:57:50,683
Yes, of course.

912
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:52,184
Can I come and see it tomorrow?

913
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:54,812
No, not tomorrow. I have to work.

914
00:57:54,895 --> 00:57:56,146
Let's do it on the weekend.

915
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:59,066
REAL ESTATE

916
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:06,990
Dad, this isn't fair.

917
00:58:10,202 --> 00:58:12,871
This space is perfect for a beauty salon.

918
00:58:12,955 --> 00:58:15,916
A deposit of 5 million
with 500,000 won a month and no premium.

919
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,464
But it's old.

920
00:58:22,548 --> 00:58:25,592
Come on, just 15 years.
That's nothing for a commercial space.

921
00:58:27,302 --> 00:58:28,971
When can I sign the lease?

922
00:58:50,075 --> 00:58:53,036
-Hi, Dad.
-I'm inside I Like You.

923
00:58:53,662 --> 00:58:55,956
I LIKE YOU
CONVENIENCE STORE

924
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,010
Guess why I like hanging out with you.

925
00:59:08,677 --> 00:59:10,179
You like everything about it.

926
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,347
I can do whatever I want.

927
00:59:12,973 --> 00:59:15,976
Mom would've nagged me
about eating cup noodles.

928
00:59:16,769 --> 00:59:18,145
I thought it was a compliment,

929
00:59:18,228 --> 00:59:20,898
-but I was wrong.
-It is a compliment!

930
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,361
It's so good.

931
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:35,162
Here.

932
00:59:40,626 --> 00:59:43,504
Home sweet home. Gosh, I'm so tired.

933
00:59:43,587 --> 00:59:46,882
Don't lie down on the couch.
Go to your room and rest up.

934
00:59:46,965 --> 00:59:49,176
No. I'm going to stay right here,
just like this.

935
00:59:57,309 --> 00:59:58,936
Dad, when are you leaving?

936
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:00,270
If you sell the house,

937
01:00:00,938 --> 01:00:01,855
where will you live?

938
01:00:01,939 --> 01:00:04,233
What I need is money.
I'm sure I'll find a place.

939
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:10,531
Talking about money totally woke me up.

940
01:00:11,824 --> 01:00:13,867
Don't sell this house.

941
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:16,370
I'll help you out.

942
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:19,790
No, it's my life.
I can take care of myself.

943
01:00:19,873 --> 01:00:21,583
I don't want to burden you.

944
01:00:26,964 --> 01:00:27,965
What?

945
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:31,051
I'm…

946
01:00:34,346 --> 01:00:35,639
I'm sorry.

947
01:00:37,975 --> 01:00:40,644
I completely ruined your childhood.

948
01:00:41,562 --> 01:00:44,773
You must've been worried because
your mom and I fought all the time.

949
01:00:46,233 --> 01:00:47,860
Yes, I was very worried.

950
01:00:49,236 --> 01:00:50,904
If I took Mom's side,

951
01:00:51,572 --> 01:00:53,282
I'd feel guilty because of you.

952
01:00:53,782 --> 01:00:55,117
And if I took your side,

953
01:00:55,951 --> 01:00:57,494
I'd feel bad for Mom.

954
01:00:59,413 --> 01:01:02,207
I also wondered if you were fighting
because of me.

955
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,669
Come to think of it, you're right.

956
01:01:05,752 --> 01:01:08,589
I was always worried about you and Mom
when I was young.

957
01:01:12,342 --> 01:01:15,554
I always tell myself
that I must be strong.

958
01:01:16,638 --> 01:01:18,432
If I start to rely on someone,

959
01:01:19,433 --> 01:01:22,895
I'll be anxious thinking
that person might leave me.

960
01:01:31,111 --> 01:01:34,364
Dad, what are you doing?
Don't be like this.

961
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:40,662
Don't cry.

962
01:01:41,163 --> 01:01:42,789
You have the right to receive help

963
01:01:42,873 --> 01:01:44,958
from your parents.
Why would I be burdened?

964
01:01:45,459 --> 01:01:47,294
You're simply rejecting me.

965
01:01:48,045 --> 01:01:50,923
You always do this to punish me.

966
01:01:51,715 --> 01:01:54,134
You say that you like me,

967
01:01:55,135 --> 01:01:58,055
but I know that
you haven't forgiven me, deep down.

968
01:02:01,558 --> 01:02:03,477
I'll stay here like this

969
01:02:05,771 --> 01:02:07,147
until you forgive me.

970
01:02:14,571 --> 01:02:16,740
Dad, why are you being like this?

971
01:02:43,499 --> 01:02:45,543
Do not stay too close.
You're smothering me.

972
01:02:45,626 --> 01:02:48,254
This is only making people
stare at me more.

973
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,136
Shall I buy one for you?

974
01:02:55,219 --> 01:02:56,595
What? That is a woman?

975
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:00,933
We are not buying this.

976
01:03:10,776 --> 01:03:12,194
Meet me at the rear gate at three.

977
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:35,217
This is where my people live.

978
01:03:36,886 --> 01:03:38,304
Let us move elsewhere.

979
01:05:10,521 --> 01:05:13,232
You should get out of here.
Yu-ri, escort His Highness!

980
01:05:13,315 --> 01:05:14,900
-Please, Your Highness.
-No.

981
01:05:14,984 --> 01:05:17,653
This country's future
depends on Your Highness!

982
01:05:17,736 --> 01:05:20,197
-Please leave!
-If we cannot leave together,

983
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,325
-I will not go.
-Your Highness!

984
01:05:23,409 --> 01:05:24,869
You are my people too!

985
01:05:28,038 --> 01:05:29,832
I will not neglect

986
01:05:34,295 --> 01:05:35,796
any single one of you.

987
01:05:47,808 --> 01:05:50,895
-Gosh!
-Oh, my!

988
01:05:51,645 --> 01:05:54,815
-Sa Hye-jun!
-Sa Hye-jun!

989
01:05:54,899 --> 01:05:57,610
-Sa Hye-jun!
-Sa Hye-jun!

990
01:05:57,693 --> 01:06:00,988
-Sa Hye-jun!
-Sa Hye-jun!

991
01:06:01,071 --> 01:06:02,072
-Sa Hye-jun!
-Wait!

992
01:06:02,156 --> 01:06:06,035
I have a better idea.
Let's create a fan club for him.

993
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,621
Who can make our heart flutter like this?

994
01:06:08,704 --> 01:06:10,247
-Our husbands?
-No!

995
01:06:10,331 --> 01:06:12,082
-Park Do-ha?
-No!

996
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:14,585
Then what should the fan club's name be?

997
01:06:14,668 --> 01:06:15,961
It's for Sa Hye-jun, so…

998
01:06:16,045 --> 01:06:18,172
-Hye-jun, Hye-jun…
-Hye-jun…

999
01:06:18,255 --> 01:06:19,757
-What can we do for him?
-Everything.

1000
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,550
Yes, anything for him.

1001
01:06:21,634 --> 01:06:23,302
-Yes!
-Hye-jun All the Way!

1002
01:06:23,385 --> 01:06:26,222
-Hye-jun All the Way!
-Hye-jun All the Way!

1003
01:06:26,305 --> 01:06:28,599
-Hye-jun All the Way!
-Hye-jun All the Way!

1004
01:06:28,682 --> 01:06:30,643
-Hye-jun All the Way!
-Hye-jun All the Way!

1005
01:06:30,726 --> 01:06:32,186
A SUPERSTAR IS BORN!

1006
01:06:32,269 --> 01:06:33,395
SA HYE-JUN, A TOP CELEBRITY

01:06:36,357 --> 01:06:39,026

1012
01:06:47,576 --> 01:06:49,078
HE MAKES MY HEART FLUTTER

1013
01:06:49,161 --> 01:06:50,913
I LOVE HIS ROMANTIC EYES

1014
01:06:50,996 --> 01:06:52,706
Hey, is this for real?

1015
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:55,251
-Do you want me to pinch you?
-Gosh, no.

1016
01:06:55,334 --> 01:06:56,335
-Hye-jun.
-Yes?

1017
01:06:56,418 --> 01:06:58,045
You're no longer just my star.

1018
01:06:58,128 --> 01:07:00,548
You're on your way to global stardom.
Superstar Sa Hye-jun.

1019
01:07:00,631 --> 01:07:02,550
Oh, please.

1020
01:07:02,633 --> 01:07:04,301
Even you are being like this?

1021
01:07:04,385 --> 01:07:07,012
You must stay focused
even if everyone is excited.

1022
01:07:07,096 --> 01:07:11,183
I would if you were overly excited,
but you're always so focused.

1023
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:13,644
-Hye-jun.
-Yes?

1024
01:07:13,727 --> 01:07:15,563
If you're named Best Actor,

1025
01:07:15,646 --> 01:07:17,523
mention my name during your speech.

1026
01:07:17,606 --> 01:07:19,400
-My goodness.
-I won't win that award.

1027
01:07:19,483 --> 01:07:21,026
They asked me to host the ceremony

1028
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:23,320
because I'm not getting any awards.

1029
01:07:23,404 --> 01:07:25,573
You should ask the scriptwriter
at the ceremony.

1030
01:07:25,656 --> 01:07:29,285
No need. I also think
Park Do-ha will win that award.

1031
01:07:29,368 --> 01:07:31,328
That's why Hye-jun was
asked to be the host.

1032
01:07:31,412 --> 01:07:33,872
Min-jae, you're my manager.

1033
01:07:33,956 --> 01:07:36,709
You have to say I'll win the award
no matter what.

1034
01:07:36,792 --> 01:07:39,253
You told me to calm down.
Why are you doing this to me?

1035
01:07:40,004 --> 01:07:42,756
Because it's fun. Teasing you is fun.

1036
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,841
You brat!

1037
01:07:43,924 --> 01:07:47,469
SA HYE-JUN NAMED HOST
FOR OVN DRAMA AWARDS

1038
01:07:51,515 --> 01:07:53,726
I have to say,
I have such a keen eye for talent.

1039
01:07:57,021 --> 01:07:58,814
I have a keen eye for talent,

1040
01:07:58,897 --> 01:08:00,816
but I just wasn't patient enough.

1041
01:08:07,406 --> 01:08:10,159
Can't you see that I'm here?
Come sit over here.

1042
01:08:10,242 --> 01:08:11,368
Yes, coming.

1043
01:08:12,202 --> 01:08:13,454
I am coming, okay?

1044
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,333
Did you see the article?

1045
01:08:19,209 --> 01:08:21,795
Hye-jun and I are both nominated
for Best Actor.

1046
01:08:22,755 --> 01:08:23,881
Can you believe that?

1047
01:08:23,964 --> 01:08:25,883
Of course, not. It is crazy.

1048
01:08:25,966 --> 01:08:28,927
I mean, how dare he?
Sa Hye-jun is no match for you.

1049
01:08:30,137 --> 01:08:31,805
That sounded totally insincere.

1050
01:08:33,182 --> 01:08:34,975
<i>Jeez, this prick is too quick-witted.</i>

1051
01:08:35,059 --> 01:08:36,477
You'll get it, without a doubt.

1052
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,354
He's hosting the ceremony.

1053
01:08:38,437 --> 01:08:40,439
Why would they ask him to host
if he was the awardee?

1054
01:08:40,522 --> 01:08:42,983
They clearly wanted to be considerate of--

1055
01:08:43,067 --> 01:08:45,069
He's that big of a deal now?

1056
01:08:45,152 --> 01:08:46,236
Yes.

1057
01:08:47,488 --> 01:08:48,572
He's a hotshot now.

1058
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,245
SA HYE-JUN NAMED HOST
FOR OVN DRAMA AWARDS

1059
01:08:55,329 --> 01:08:56,580
I KNEW HE'D MAKE IT BIG

1060
01:08:56,664 --> 01:08:57,831
I LOVE SA HYE-JUN SO MUCH

1061
01:09:00,084 --> 01:09:01,418
SA HYE-JUN RISES TO STARDOM

1062
01:09:01,502 --> 01:09:03,170
PARK DO-HA VS SA HYE-JUN

1063
01:09:03,253 --> 01:09:05,881
WHO WILL BE NAMED BEST ACTOR
AT OVN DRAMA AWARDS?

1064
01:09:08,842 --> 01:09:10,511
I'm so upset.

1065
01:09:10,594 --> 01:09:12,680
They're only talking about
Hye-jun and Do-ha.

1066
01:09:18,519 --> 01:09:19,603
Ma'am.

1067
01:09:20,187 --> 01:09:22,439
"Ma'am"? Please, Gyeong-mi.

1068
01:09:22,523 --> 01:09:24,274
I prefer calling you like that.

1069
01:09:24,358 --> 01:09:27,861
I don't like it. I don't want my kids
to think I'm a pompous stuck-up.

1070
01:09:27,945 --> 01:09:29,113
What's she saying?

1071
01:09:30,823 --> 01:09:32,950
You must be stressed out these days.

1072
01:09:33,033 --> 01:09:33,992
Why would I be?

1073
01:09:34,076 --> 01:09:36,078
Things are going so well for Hye-jun.

1074
01:09:36,161 --> 01:09:38,372
He's hosting the ceremony
and has been nominated.

1075
01:09:38,455 --> 01:09:42,126
You've been looking after everything for
Hae-hyo, but his career isn't taking off.

1076
01:09:42,209 --> 01:09:44,294
<i>Is she deliberately trying
to get on my nerves?</i>

1077
01:09:45,921 --> 01:09:48,215
That's not true.
He'll be named Rookie of the Year.

1078
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:51,093
Also, Hye-jun is just a nominee.

1079
01:09:51,176 --> 01:09:52,261
He will win the award.

1080
01:09:52,344 --> 01:09:55,180
I'm going to the ceremony too.
Ae-suk asked me to come.

1081
01:09:55,264 --> 01:09:56,974
My gosh.

1082
01:09:57,057 --> 01:09:59,810
Ma'am. I mean, I-yeong.
Will you be there too?

1083
01:09:59,893 --> 01:10:02,479
<i>Now that she's calling me
by my first name, I'm really annoyed.</i>

1084
01:10:03,689 --> 01:10:04,857
No, I won't be there.

1085
01:10:07,484 --> 01:10:08,777
-Aren't you leaving?
-I am.

1086
01:10:11,488 --> 01:10:13,866
I put all the side dishes in the fridge.

1087
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:22,166
FOLLOWERS, 1M

1088
01:10:27,004 --> 01:10:28,297
What are you doing?

1089
01:10:29,131 --> 01:10:31,008
Mom, I've reached one million followers.

1090
01:10:31,842 --> 01:10:33,469
-So you're happy?
-I am, of course.

1091
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:38,974
What is this?

1092
01:10:39,057 --> 01:10:40,726
I got it for the award ceremony.

1093
01:10:42,227 --> 01:10:43,437
How do you feel

1094
01:10:44,897 --> 01:10:47,399
when you see Hye-jun these days?

1095
01:10:47,483 --> 01:10:50,569
Well, I'm really happy for him.

1096
01:10:50,652 --> 01:10:51,779
He's been through a lot.

1097
01:10:52,488 --> 01:10:53,989
That's all?

1098
01:10:54,072 --> 01:10:55,699
Why? What else?

1099
01:10:55,783 --> 01:10:57,618
I hope he wins the award for Best Actor.

1100
01:10:59,453 --> 01:11:01,455
Is it my fault
that you turned out like this?

1101
01:11:03,457 --> 01:11:05,250
Probably. You raised me.

1102
01:11:05,334 --> 01:11:08,420
-And you raised me well.
-My blood is boiling right now.

1103
01:11:08,504 --> 01:11:09,671
How can you smile?

1104
01:11:09,755 --> 01:11:12,341
I did all I could
to give you the support you needed.

1105
01:11:12,424 --> 01:11:14,343
How could you disappoint me like this?

1106
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:17,054
I can't sleep because of you.

1107
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:19,139
You are the problem. You're too laid-back.

1108
01:11:19,223 --> 01:11:21,183
Why are you so excited
about your follower count?

1109
01:11:21,266 --> 01:11:22,684
Why am I so excited?

1110
01:11:23,268 --> 01:11:26,522
I have one million followers
who are my fans.

1111
01:11:26,605 --> 01:11:29,191
Numbers like that are fake.
Do you want to know what's real?

1112
01:11:30,692 --> 01:11:33,403
Being applauded on stage like Hye-jun.

1113
01:11:40,702 --> 01:11:42,704
You are watching

1114
01:11:42,788 --> 01:11:44,957
the 2019 OVN Drama Awards live.

1115
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,584
Now, we will announce
the winner for Best Actor

1116
01:11:47,668 --> 01:11:49,795
for the miniseries category.

1117
01:11:49,878 --> 01:11:51,421
-Hye-jun.
-Yes.

1118
01:11:51,505 --> 01:11:53,215
-You must be nervous.
-Me?

1119
01:11:53,924 --> 01:11:56,134
-Why do you ask?
-Why, I wonder.

1120
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,387
I love what you're wearing today.

1121
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,430
It's the most perfect outfit
for this award.

1122
01:12:00,514 --> 01:12:01,849
Thank you.

1123
01:12:02,391 --> 01:12:04,560
-And you look stunning today.
-Thank you.

1124
01:12:04,643 --> 01:12:06,854
-Shall we announce the winner?
-Shall we?

1125
01:12:06,937 --> 01:12:09,481
Last year's winner, Song Min-su,

1126
01:12:09,565 --> 01:12:11,149
will present the award.

1127
01:12:16,947 --> 01:12:19,658
Personally, I'm a big fan of Min-su.

1128
01:12:20,701 --> 01:12:23,453
He also started out as a model, didn't he?

1129
01:12:23,537 --> 01:12:26,415
Are you two close?

1130
01:12:26,498 --> 01:12:28,125
Hello, I'm Song Min-su.

1131
01:12:31,169 --> 01:12:34,506
Hi, Hye-jun.
I haven't been able to reach you.

1132
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:37,384
Are you ignoring my calls
now that you're popular?

1133
01:12:37,467 --> 01:12:40,721
Min-su, I changed my number.

1134
01:12:42,139 --> 01:12:43,724
-For real?
-No, I was just kidding.

1135
01:12:43,807 --> 01:12:45,684
I was just kidding too.

1136
01:12:46,852 --> 01:12:49,354
When I was standing on this stage
last year,

1137
01:12:49,438 --> 01:12:52,274
I was so nervous
that I couldn't really enjoy the ceremony.

1138
01:12:52,357 --> 01:12:54,902
Today, I'd like to enjoy it
to the fullest.

1139
01:12:55,861 --> 01:12:58,488
First, let's meet the nominees

1140
01:12:58,572 --> 01:13:01,533
for Best Actor
for the miniseries category.

1141
01:13:03,243 --> 01:13:04,494
BEST ACTOR

1142
01:13:05,996 --> 01:13:07,789
Sa Hye-jun, from <i>The King Returns</i>.

1143
01:13:08,332 --> 01:13:09,666
<i>If we cannot leave together,</i>

1144
01:13:10,876 --> 01:13:12,044
<i>I will not go.</i>

1145
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:20,093
Park Do-ha, from <i>Catch.</i>

1146
01:13:20,594 --> 01:13:23,388
<i>Jeez, call the cops!</i>

1147
01:13:29,144 --> 01:13:31,855
Those are the nominees.

1148
01:13:31,939 --> 01:13:34,733
Let me cut to the chase
and announce the winner.

1149
01:13:35,233 --> 01:13:38,195
The 2019 OVN Drama Awards.

1150
01:13:38,278 --> 01:13:41,490
Best Actor for the miniseries category
goes to…

1151
01:13:48,872 --> 01:13:50,791
I see. This actor is the winner.

1152
01:13:51,959 --> 01:13:54,628
Sa Hye-jun, <i>The King Returns</i>.
Congratulations.

1153
01:14:39,506 --> 01:14:42,384
BEST ACTOR

1154
01:14:46,972 --> 01:14:48,140
Thank you.

1155
01:14:51,143 --> 01:14:52,227
BEST ACTOR
SA HYE-JUN

1156
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:54,354
Who knew this day would come?

1157
01:14:58,358 --> 01:15:00,318
Up until just a year ago,

1158
01:15:00,402 --> 01:15:03,613
I was an unknown aspiring actor
who had multiple part-time jobs.

1159
01:15:03,697 --> 01:15:08,410
My grandfather encouraged
and supported me all through those years.

1160
01:15:09,786 --> 01:15:10,746
Thank you, Grandpa.

1161
01:15:11,788 --> 01:15:14,791
And Mom, I love you.

1162
01:15:16,293 --> 01:15:20,172
Last but not least,
all the members of Hye-jun All the Way.

1163
01:15:20,922 --> 01:15:22,090
Thank you.

RECORD OF YOUTH

1166
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,703
This doesn't feel real.

1167
01:16:35,205 --> 01:16:38,166
Yes, I was upset so many times.

1168
01:16:39,751 --> 01:16:41,503
Min-jae, have you seen Jeong-ha?

1169
01:16:42,462 --> 01:16:43,964
You left out Dad though.

1170
01:16:44,047 --> 01:16:45,590
Must you be so childish?

1171
01:16:45,674 --> 01:16:48,301
What is it that you want to be?
A star or an actor?

1172
01:16:48,385 --> 01:16:50,512
I hate being compared to Hye-jun.

1173
01:16:51,471 --> 01:16:52,514
I'm Hye-jun's friend.

1174
01:16:52,597 --> 01:16:54,724
-Don't do this again.
-I really miss this.

1175
01:16:56,518 --> 01:16:58,436
Just don't get a photo taken
hugging each other or something like that.

1176
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,689
Do you know someone named Charlie Jung?
