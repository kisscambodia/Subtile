RECORD OF YOUTH

2
00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:07,705
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS AN
"EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT" AND IS SUPPORTED

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,570
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, TOURISM
AND THE KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

4
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:42,170
I…

5
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:45,757
I would like to ask the rescue squad
on standby

6
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:50,554
to immediately start searching
the point of the fall you just saw.

7
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:55,350
I’m sure there are survivors.

8
00:00:57,185 --> 00:01:00,147
You can save all of them.
Please hurry and find them.

9
00:01:04,693 --> 00:01:05,694
Mr. Park No-gyu.

10
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:08,280
Mr. Park No-gyu.

11
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,576
You wanted an apology from the President,
but you hung up. Is this it now?

12
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:14,077
Is it?

13
00:01:16,413 --> 00:01:18,081
You were going to kill anyway, right?

14
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:26,882
I like it.

15
00:01:27,382 --> 00:01:29,051
His version is different
from Ha Jung-woo’s.

16
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:32,054
As I told you before,
I think Hae-hyo’s version is better.

17
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:34,848
What’s this guy’s name?

18
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:39,353
Let’s be real. We don't even know
his name. Why cast him, then?

19
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:40,354
What’s his name?

20
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:52,115
ACTOR PARK DO-HA'S GREEN ROOM

21
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:07,422
ACTOR PARK DO-HA'S GREEN ROOM

22
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,011
-He’s inside, right?
-No one is allowed inside.

23
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:16,473
I’m not just anyone.

24
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:19,059
I’m the makeup artist, Lee Bo-ra.

25
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:23,063
What?

26
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:25,232
You just touched me.

27
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:27,984
This is sexual harassment.

28
00:02:29,277 --> 00:02:30,278
Move.

29
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:33,407
Care to go over the facts?

30
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:41,289
Don’t let anyone inside,

31
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:43,417
especially Lee Bo-ra.

32
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,044
She’s like a leech.

33
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:48,088
I'm really sick of her.

34
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,264
By the way, you look familiar.

35
00:02:58,598 --> 00:02:59,724
Where have I seen you?

36
00:03:01,435 --> 00:03:03,103
I got it. Just move out of my way.

37
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,355
You still want to go in?

38
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,065
I’ll be the one
who ends this relationship.

39
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,735
-Can't I go in?
-No.

40
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:11,403
I must follow my orders.

41
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:15,699
But there’s an exception

42
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:20,370
if I'm physically unable to stop you.

43
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:34,885
We dated for five years.

44
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:38,638
It was hard to process our breakup,
so I know I’ve been clingy.

45
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:41,892
But did you really have to treat me
like some trash?

46
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:47,689
So what do you want from me?

47
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:48,857
Let's break up.

48
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,234
I’m ending this relationship, not you.

49
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:53,904
Whenever I see you, I want to punch you.

50
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:56,698
Even if you do deserve to be punched,
I shouldn’t be violent

51
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:58,575
because I’m a good person.

52
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:00,952
You’re completely full of yourself.

53
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:06,625
Hey!

54
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:23,809
Hey.

55
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:26,978
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

56
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:29,481
Didn’t I tell you to not let her inside?

57
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:30,732
I tried my best to stop her.

58
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:32,692
Your best?

59
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:34,694
Your best?

60
00:04:47,582 --> 00:04:48,917
-Blood?
-You looked familiar,

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,710
so I looked you up earlier.

62
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:53,296
You’re a model.
It looked like you had a decent career.

63
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,923
But what happened to your life?

64
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:57,592
What happened?

65
00:04:58,134 --> 00:04:59,970
What? What’s wrong with my life?

66
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:01,471
What? I can't talk casually?

67
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:03,640
I looked you up, too.
It turns out we’re the same age.

68
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:06,059
So let’s forget about honorifics.
You started it first.

69
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:08,562
You’ve got to be out of your mind!

70
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,025
<i>My dream is to have what this jerk has.</i>

71
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:23,326
<i>Even a jerk like him can make it here.</i>

72
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,995
<i>But I don’t have</i>

73
00:05:25,704 --> 00:05:27,080
<i>much time left.</i>

74
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:47,267
FOLLOW

75
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:09,919
RECORD OF YOUTH

76
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:15,420
Yes. That's it.

77
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:18,221
Look into the camera. Gaze into it.

78
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:20,967
Okay. That's it.

79
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:22,844
Great job. Nice.

80
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:24,638
Good.

81
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:26,306
-There you go.
-Yes.

82
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:28,058
Here we go. It's the last one!

83
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:29,976
Okay! We're done.

84
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:34,981
You need to exercise.

85
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:37,359
Stop calling me in the middle
of the night for a run.

86
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:38,860
We have our reasons.

87
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:40,737
Your cholesterol level is high.

88
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:42,572
Please take care of yourself.

89
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,826
I’ll take care of my health.
So you just take care of yours.

90
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,620
Or why don't we just take care
of ourselves?

91
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:50,038
Wake up, man.

92
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:55,794
But there’s one thing
I have the upper hand over you guys.

93
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:58,755
It’s not just one. You have about three.

94
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:02,258
You sure have a way with words, don’t you?

95
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:03,885
You didn’t even serve in the military.

96
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:05,470
That was Jin-u's daily mention

97
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:07,263
of his military service.

98
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:10,892
That must be Hye-jun. He posted a photo.

99
00:07:10,976 --> 00:07:11,977
I bet 500 won he didn’t.

100
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,979
Hey, you got a lot of followers now.

101
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:17,023
You have more followers
than Yoo Seung-ho and Choi Jin-hyuk.

102
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:18,775
I don't know why. I didn't do anything.

103
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:21,152
Excessive modesty can be annoying!

104
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:22,988
I’m not being modest. It’s a fact.

105
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:24,614
Do I owe you 500 won?

106
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:27,659
But what happened to his face?

107
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:29,035
Did he get beaten up at work?

108
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,120
THE MOST DEMANDING JOB

109
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:31,621
Why would he get beaten up?

110
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:32,872
#PART-TIME JOB #SOMEDAY

111
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:36,876
A silver spooner like you wouldn’t know
the sorrow of a dirt spooner.

112
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,294
That’s too brutal, man.

113
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:41,172
Aren’t they supposed
to announce their decision for the role?

114
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:42,590
What if he doesn’t get the role?

115
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:45,093
Must you ask? He’s got me.
I’ll take care of him.

116
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:47,303
Can you take care of me, too?

117
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:49,723
-Sir.
-You said you wanted to be on your own.

118
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:51,474
-Come on.
-Mr. Kim, go away.

119
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:52,392
Mr. Won.

120
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:55,895
-I bet 500 won it's your mother.
-Do you think I only get calls from her?

121
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,439
-Who is it?
-What are you doing?

122
00:07:58,064 --> 00:07:59,607
Are you here to play?

123
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:01,484
Do you think
you and Hae-hyo have the same jobs?

124
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,778
You owe me 1,000 won in total.

125
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:05,071
It's not her.

126
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,576
Hey, Mom.

127
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:11,369
You have a photoshoot.
Why aren't you here?

128
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:12,620
<i>Where are you?</i>

129
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:15,915
You were supposed to get your hair done
at the hair salon I go.

130
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,834
<i>I said no to that.</i>

131
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:21,004
I don’t like your hairstyle.
It looks lame.

132
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:23,715
Forget it. Stop trying to sound hip.

133
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:25,800
Let’s talk at home. Bye.

134
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,094
Gosh.

135
00:08:29,345 --> 00:08:31,473
What’s taking Jin-ju so long?

136
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:33,141
She’s talking to the salon director.

137
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:34,642
Can I serve you beverages?

138
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:36,603
She's taking too long.

139
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:38,688
Can you just do my makeup?
I don’t want to wait.

140
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:40,774
I'm not ready to do that yet.

141
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:41,733
She’ll be here soon.

142
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,444
Just do it when I tell you to.

143
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:45,904
You did my makeup before.

144
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:48,698
I just did the base makeup
before Jin-ju did--

145
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:50,241
You’re so chatty.

146
00:08:52,035 --> 00:08:53,078
Should I just leave, then?

147
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:55,497
Then…

148
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:02,253
What are you doing?

149
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:03,963
I'm sanitizing my hands.

150
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:06,674
I like that.

151
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:09,511
Some makeup artists touch your face
without washing their hands first.

152
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:12,847
I knew you were different
when you did my makeup the other day.

153
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,057
You're not like the others.

154
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:15,767
Thank you.

155
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:18,812
What kind of meeting is this?
Is it a formal occasion?

156
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:19,938
It’s a casual meeting.

157
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:23,358
Then I’ll make you look
effortlessly beautiful.

158
00:09:41,376 --> 00:09:43,044
You have beautiful eyes.

159
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:45,547
Keep telling me that I'm pretty.

160
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:47,465
It puts me in a good mood.

161
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:51,511
In five minutes. If I say it again now,
it won’t sound sincere.

162
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:55,723
Gosh, you’re so witty!

163
00:09:57,225 --> 00:09:58,726
I’m sorry the talk ran long.

164
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,353
I’ll take over once she’s done.

165
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,856
I want her to do my makeup today.

166
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:04,691
"An Jeong-ha"?

167
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:06,067
Pardon?

168
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:08,528
I’ll assist
after I finish the base makeup.

169
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:09,946
I said I didn't want that.

170
00:10:11,865 --> 00:10:14,450
You’re slacking off lately.

171
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:16,619
I hate waiting.

172
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,246
I’m sorry, Professor Kim.

173
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,332
Go on.

174
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,333
Okay.

175
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:34,929
Take care.

176
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,306
-Have a good weekend.
-Bye.

177
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:46,941
Are you happy?

178
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,693
Pardon?

179
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:51,070
You think you’re better
because you worked at a big company?

180
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:53,364
Ma'am.

181
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:56,826
Do you have any respect for me?

182
00:10:57,327 --> 00:11:01,831
You must think you can do whatever
you want because the director likes you.

183
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:06,628
I’ve been working in this industry
for ten years.

184
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:10,006
I've never seen a bitch who steals clients
becomes a good makeup artist.

185
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:11,591
If you ever try to steal my clients--

186
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:13,843
I’m sorry to interrupt you,

187
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:15,929
but I told her I couldn’t.
She was persistent.

188
00:11:16,012 --> 00:11:17,805
-So I had no choice--
-“No choice”?

189
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:21,059
That’s what they all say.
They all didn't have a choice.

190
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:22,852
Drop that crappy excuse.

191
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:27,315
If it happens again,

192
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:31,110
I’ll make you realize that you had it easy

193
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:32,612
with your office job.

194
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:56,636
She scolded you again, right?

195
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,723
That’s her inferiority complex.
I’m telling you. That's why she does that.

196
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,558
Why would she feel inferior to me?

197
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:04,143
Because you’re good.

198
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:08,439
Thanks, Su-bin.

199
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:11,359
It’s been over a million years
since someone complimented me.

200
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:13,987
Really? Then, do you like me
more than Sa Hye-jun?

201
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:15,697
Not that much.

202
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,699
-Okay. You sounded firm.
-Yes.

203
00:12:17,782 --> 00:12:20,034
-You’re such a diligent fangirl.
-I am.

204
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:23,496
Jin-ju is going
to the Homme fashion show tomorrow.

205
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,040
Tell her you’ll go with her.
I’m sure he’ll be there, too.

206
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,084
I don’t want to force it.

207
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:29,460
We’ll meet when it’s time.

208
00:12:29,544 --> 00:12:31,713
And I’ll do my best until that day comes.

209
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:33,756
He might be gone from this industry.

210
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,592
He’s a popular model,
but he’s not doing well as an actor.

211
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,553
Hey.

212
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:39,470
That’s the truth.

213
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,140
I heard he was born with a silver spoon.

214
00:12:42,223 --> 00:12:43,474
He lives in Hannam-dong.

215
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:46,144
I bet he doesn’t need to
make money from his job.

216
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:49,939
Hey, you’re so mean.

217
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:51,858
I take back my thank-you.

218
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:56,154
Hye-jun does live in Hannam-dong,
but he wasn’t born with a silver spoon.

219
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:58,489
He works really hard. And he’s kind, too.

220
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:01,868
Jeong-ha, the most pathetic thing
a fangirl can do is complimenting

221
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:03,202
a celebrity’s personality.

222
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:05,580
How do you know he’s kind in real life?

223
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,748
<i>We have a customer.</i>

224
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:08,082
Get back to work.

225
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,293
Why are you so grumpy?

226
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:13,087
Some people might think
you’re his girlfriend.

227
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:16,883
<i>Please come down quickly.</i>

228
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:23,848
Now that she brought him up,
let me take a quick look at his face.

229
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:28,603
Hye-jun.

230
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:32,648
Fangirling over you
is what keeps me going.

231
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:35,485
How are you hanging in there?

232
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:41,783
MY BIAS

233
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,839
HEADING OFF TO A WARM PLACE #KOTA KINABALU

00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:10,186
<i>My friend's dream protects him.</i>

235
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:12,230
<i>But my dream is</i>

236
00:14:13,106 --> 00:14:14,857
<i>like homework that costs a lot of money.</i>

<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

242
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:44,220
You are the one who’s out of your mind.

243
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:48,266
You still didn’t pay me for
the last fashion show and previous gigs.

244
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:51,269
I stopped Park Do-ha from suing you.

245
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:54,063
I did nothing wrong. This will
get me two weeks in the hospital.

246
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:56,482
And I made sure I didn't fight back
even for self-defense.

247
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:58,401
Besides, deflecting the conversation

248
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:00,153
doesn’t work anymore.

249
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:01,112
Hye-jun.

250
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:06,242
As you know, the agency isn’t doing well.

251
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:08,619
Imagine how bad it must be.
I can't even pay you.

252
00:15:08,703 --> 00:15:10,955
Stop trying to make me feel bad.

253
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,042
This isn’t your first time.
How can you always pay me late?

254
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:18,296
Why do I have to beg you to pay me?

255
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:20,548
When other models left,
saying you were an asshole,

256
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,425
I told them that you would have paid them

257
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:24,886
if you had the money.
I trusted you and decided to stay.

258
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:27,096
So why did you trust me?

259
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:32,477
This is why you’ll never make it here.
You’re too naive.

260
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,189
That’s why I’m managing your finances.

261
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,107
Gosh, this money talk…

262
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:40,318
Did I scare you?

263
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,905
Come on, it’s us. It's just money.

264
00:15:43,988 --> 00:15:44,989
Can money get between us?

265
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,325
I can’t believe this.

266
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:49,577
You should pay Hye-jun for his work.

267
00:15:50,828 --> 00:15:53,122
You said you were quitting.

268
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:55,583
If you’re done packing, leave.

269
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,336
You’re pathetic.
How can you prey on these models?

270
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:00,379
Until when do you think
you can keep this up?

271
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:02,423
You’re pouring it out
now that you’re quitting.

272
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:05,676
You think we won’t cross paths?
Ms. Lee Min-jae.

273
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,803
This is a small world.

274
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:09,722
You think we won’t cross paths,
but we will.

275
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:11,265
We all work in the same industry.

276
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:13,267
Just leave quietly.

277
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:17,104
I'm leaving this industry,
and I won’t ever see you again.

278
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:19,190
I’ll do a good deed while I'm at it.

279
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:21,776
I’ve been itching to do a good deed
while working here.

280
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,696
You’re full of crap.

281
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,949
I see. You like crap.

282
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,742
Which crap should I start with?

283
00:16:29,825 --> 00:16:32,787
Should I talk to the press first?
Or your wife?

284
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,581
No. Should I head
to the Labor Office first?

285
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:37,208
Are you threatening me?

286
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,211
If you think I’m threatening you,

287
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:42,338
it means you have a lot of crap.

288
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:46,884
This is why I respect you.

289
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:49,845
You sure know your place, so you’ll
continue to be on this successful path.

290
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:52,265
So you’d better pay Hye-jun.

291
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:54,642
Don’t be a cheapskate
who steals from kids. Okay?

292
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,102
No, not okay.

293
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:58,563
Let’s see which one will get you
to change your mind.

294
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:01,649
It’s probably your wife.
You’ll see her tonight.

295
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:12,493
-What is this?
-I had to clean up

296
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:14,620
whenever you broke up with them.
Don’t you remember?

297
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:16,455
So what will you do with them?

298
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:17,498
With these photos?

299
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:19,584
NEW MESSAGE TO MR. LEE'S WIFE

300
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:23,087
If you don’t pay him,

301
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,840
I’m moving onto plan B.

302
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:43,774
-What are you doing?
-I opened the door.

303
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:46,319
Exactly. Why are you doing that?

304
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:47,820
Be my agent, Min-jae.

305
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,574
-What?
-I need someone like you.

306
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,412
Let’s talk after you get the money first.

307
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:58,331
It’s so easy to win you over.

308
00:17:58,414 --> 00:18:00,916
This is why you get conned.

309
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,586
The con artists are the problem,
not the victims.

310
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,172
That kind of perspective
gives an excuse to the con artists.

311
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:07,923
And that's called victim blaming.

312
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:09,842
Aren’t you a smooth talker?

313
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:11,969
I said I'm leaving this industry.

314
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:15,139
I’m not stopping you.
But I work in a different industry.

315
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:17,433
Min-jae.

316
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:19,977
Min-jae, I'm not done talking to you yet.
Please?

317
00:18:24,732 --> 00:18:25,691
That was cool.

318
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:27,860
You made my heart race for a second.

319
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:31,197
What? Min-jae.

320
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:50,966
Who are you going to trust
other than your husband?

321
00:18:54,553 --> 00:18:57,807
Hold on. I’ve got to go. I have a client.

322
00:18:58,307 --> 00:19:00,267
I have to make money

323
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:04,397
to feed our family.

324
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:06,190
Okay.

325
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:10,820
Why are you back?
Look at this. Are you happy now?

326
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:12,863
We should finish our conversation.

327
00:19:12,947 --> 00:19:13,781
What conversation?

328
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:16,617
Our contract can be terminated
if either party requests it.

329
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,162
-I'm sure you remember that.
-You must think

330
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:21,997
you’re some big shot model.

331
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:23,958
Let’s write a cancelation of the contract.

332
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:24,875
Suit yourself.

333
00:19:26,502 --> 00:19:29,255
How could you bite the hand
that feeds you?

334
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:32,717
Don't you know that I did everything
in my power to help you?

335
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,635
If you say you did this to help me

336
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:36,804
one more time, I’ll punch you.

337
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:38,931
Okay. Fine.

338
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,600
Let’s split up, then.

339
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:45,855
-But I can’t pay you.
-You can just have it.

340
00:19:46,564 --> 00:19:49,525
It’s a small price I’m paying
to get away from an asshole like you.

341
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:54,155
You’ve been a model for seven years.

342
00:19:55,114 --> 00:19:57,658
You became a top model
which was the peak for you.

343
00:19:57,742 --> 00:20:00,619
And who made that happen? It’s me.

344
00:20:01,412 --> 00:20:03,873
How do you think you can make it
as an actor without me?

345
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:06,917
It won’t work out for you.

346
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,341
What is it?

347
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:17,261
What?

348
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,101
Do you want to punch me?

349
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,688
I’m saying this for your sake.

350
00:20:41,452 --> 00:20:42,453
I won’t punch you.

351
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:45,623
You’re not worth it.

352
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,752
Do you think you and Hae-hyo
are in the same boat?

353
00:20:50,503 --> 00:20:51,587
Do you think

354
00:20:53,214 --> 00:20:55,007
you can be like Hae-hyo?

355
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,051
Hye-jun.

356
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:01,096
Isn’t that what you’re insecure about?

357
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:06,435
Let's do push-ups first.

358
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:08,145
Go up.

359
00:21:10,022 --> 00:21:11,148
And come down.

360
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:13,776
Inhale and come down.

361
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:15,736
Exhale and tuck your tailbone.

362
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,205
Open up your chest a bit as you inhale.

363
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,459
Exhale. Keep breathing.

364
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:39,385
What are you doing?

365
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:42,930
I’m showing you that I’m not like you.

366
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:48,435
Hae-hyo is my friend.

367
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:51,188
I've never wanted to be like him.

368
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:53,399
As if.

369
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:04,868
LEE TAE-SU

370
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:09,790
SA HYE-JUN

371
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,126
What a load off my chest this is.

372
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:14,211
Seriously, having you--

373
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:16,755
I could have put you in jail.
Stop talking.

374
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:20,134
Even if you take this to court,
you won’t get the money.

375
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:23,387
I’d rather pay the fine
instead of paying you.

376
00:22:25,598 --> 00:22:27,725
Do you know why I don’t want the money?

377
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:29,810
Because I know you won’t pay me.

378
00:22:29,893 --> 00:22:33,188
To get that money,
I have to get my hands dirtier than yours.

379
00:22:34,982 --> 00:22:36,692
And I don’t have time for that crap.

380
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:40,863
You'll never make it here.

381
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:45,200
You’ll be Hae-hyo’s sidekick
for the rest of your life.

382
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:01,759
<i>Have a good day, my grandchild.</i>

383
00:23:07,556 --> 00:23:08,557
<i>What are you up to?</i>

384
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:14,146
<i>I'm having fun.</i>

385
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:22,279
He texted me back right away.
I can call him then.

386
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:32,581
GRANDPA

387
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:43,092
Hey, Grandpa.

388
00:23:43,717 --> 00:23:45,594
<i>What are you doing?</i>

389
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:47,554
I’m having fun, too.

390
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:48,681
<i>Nice.</i>

391
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:51,308
Do you want some money?

392
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:52,810
<i>That’d be great.</i>

393
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:55,229
<i>Did you make a lot of money?</i>

394
00:23:56,063 --> 00:23:57,481
No.

395
00:23:57,564 --> 00:23:59,650
<i>Then, you shouldn’t.</i>

396
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:01,485
I can make money later.

397
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:03,278
That’s not it.

398
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:05,030
I’m telling you. You’ll make it.

399
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:06,740
<i>I’m sure of it.</i>

400
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:09,910
<i>I’ve never seen a kid as talented as you.</i>

401
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:12,955
That’s why Dad always scolds you.

402
00:24:13,455 --> 00:24:14,832
Your dad is scary.

403
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:17,418
Come home early. I’m nothing without you.

404
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:20,671
Mr. Sa Min-gi,
when did you become such a coward?

405
00:24:20,754 --> 00:24:23,090
Grandpa, you outrank Dad.

406
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:26,260
It's quite the contrary.

407
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:28,887
Hye-jun, we ought to face reality,
you know?

408
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:31,140
Nonetheless, you’re the best!

409
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:34,184
Grandpa, you're indeed
a good judge of character.

410
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:36,854
<i>I know your acting career
hasn't been going well,</i>

411
00:24:36,937 --> 00:24:38,397
<i>but a gem is bound to shine.</i>

412
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,648
<i>And you're a gem.</i>

413
00:24:40,441 --> 00:24:42,192
I should give you
more allowance next month.

414
00:24:42,276 --> 00:24:43,861
Thank you.

415
00:24:43,944 --> 00:24:47,990
Now that I talked to you,
I'll go have some fun!

416
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:52,578
What? Yes. Okay.

417
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:16,964
Did you switch shifts?

418
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:18,465
Nice to see you. It's been a while.

419
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:21,093
Same here. You should take orders.

420
00:25:21,176 --> 00:25:22,344
Why?

421
00:25:22,428 --> 00:25:23,554
Look over there.

422
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:30,769
What are you going to do?

423
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:32,146
I'm taking orders today.

424
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:33,355
I'll go first.

425
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,898
-Me!
-Me!

426
00:25:35,607 --> 00:25:36,442
What would you like?

427
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:38,485
Can you recommend me one?

428
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:41,488
How about Italian BMT?

429
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:42,614
I like it.

430
00:25:43,198 --> 00:25:44,199
Okay.

431
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,585
Everything looks the same.

432
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:56,879
I don’t see anything better
than the last season.

433
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:08,682
The dahlia is too long. Cut it a bit.

434
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:11,810
<i>It stands out more
and is prettier because it’s long.</i>

435
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:12,936
Okay.

436
00:26:13,437 --> 00:26:15,689
Oh, right.
I forgot to put it in the hamper.

437
00:26:15,773 --> 00:26:18,066
-I need you to hand-wash something.
-Wait.

438
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:21,653
Can’t you see that I changed to leave?

439
00:26:21,737 --> 00:26:24,323
<i>How would I know if you changed or not?</i>

440
00:26:24,406 --> 00:26:26,241
<i>I see. So your time is up, right?</i>

441
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:29,828
It won’t take long to wash it.

442
00:26:29,912 --> 00:26:32,498
I have to go home early today.

443
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:33,665
Can’t you just do it?

444
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:35,209
I’ll do it next time I come.

445
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:38,253
Today was my oldest’s first day at work.
We’re celebrating today.

446
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:41,131
We even invited our neighbors,
so I have to go grocery shopping.

447
00:26:41,215 --> 00:26:44,426
You have to throw a block party
when you get a job these days?

448
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:47,888
If it’s that hard to get a job,
how did he get a job?

449
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:51,308
He has a lot of qualifications.

450
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:55,020
<i>College diplomas from prestigious schools?
I’m not jealous at all.</i>

451
00:26:55,103 --> 00:26:58,232
<i>Even if he works at a conglomerate,
he'll work like a dog.</i>

452
00:26:58,315 --> 00:27:02,778
Which company? If you had told me,
I could've recommended him for our school.

453
00:27:02,861 --> 00:27:05,447
<i>He’d be better off unemployed
than working at that school.</i>

454
00:27:05,531 --> 00:27:08,158
He got a few offers, so he just chose one.

455
00:27:08,242 --> 00:27:09,785
So which company is it?

456
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:12,704
If you want to brag, go ahead.
Don’t stall time.

457
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:15,457
You would've been done with the laundry
had you just told me.

458
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:17,251
<i>So we’re back to that.</i>

459
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:19,920
Goodness, I should hurry.

460
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:27,386
Oh, my. Look at her deflecting.

461
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:29,805
How could she say no like that

462
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:32,641
when she's been working for me
all this time?

463
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:44,778
People say we all have to do things
that we don’t want to.

464
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:45,946
But that’s all a lie.

465
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:49,908
It’s not like this is the first time
I realized the world isn’t fair.

466
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:52,411
This life is already a bust.

467
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:54,746
Complaining won’t do me any good.

468
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:04,423
GROUP CHAT: HUSBAND

469
00:28:04,506 --> 00:28:06,049
<i>Don’t forget we’re having dinner today.</i>

470
00:28:06,675 --> 00:28:08,468
I didn’t forget. He’s checking it again.

471
00:28:09,678 --> 00:28:10,804
<i>I’ll be late.</i>

472
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:12,639
Why is he coming late?

473
00:28:12,723 --> 00:28:14,808
His dad is going to give him an earful.

474
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,188
I can’t mediate
when he won’t cooperate with me.

475
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:20,355
<i>Be on time no matter what.</i>

476
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:23,692
“No matter what”?
It’s okay to be a bit late.

477
00:28:23,775 --> 00:28:24,818
It's no big deal.

478
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:30,073
Well, he said he had work.

479
00:28:30,157 --> 00:28:31,325
Is he done with work?

480
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:33,911
BE ON…

481
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:38,624
Tell me if there’s anything you want
to eat. I’ll tell Ae-suk to cook it.

482
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:41,210
I’m sure she’ll prepare a great meal.

483
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:45,422
I envy you.

484
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:48,383
Now that Gyeong-jun got a job,
you only have Hye-jun to worry about.

485
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:49,676
He’s the problem.

486
00:28:50,385 --> 00:28:52,888
He has his head in the clouds.

487
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:54,765
But when he was on TV and in magazines,

488
00:28:54,848 --> 00:28:57,601
you’d still smile while complaining.

489
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:59,144
Did you think I was happy about it?

490
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:02,105
I just thought he was able
to make a living out of his looks.

491
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:06,193
If it didn’t work out at all,
he wouldn’t have false hope.

492
00:29:06,276 --> 00:29:09,321
If it didn't work out for seven years,
he must quit. He can't seem to give up.

493
00:29:11,406 --> 00:29:14,076
I hope he tags along and learns the trade.

494
00:29:14,993 --> 00:29:17,746
If Jin-u was as handsome as Hye-jun,

495
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:19,623
I would've helped him with all I've got.

496
00:29:19,706 --> 00:29:21,667
Why would you want him to do what we do?

497
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:24,503
If he knows a few skills,
he won’t at least starve.

498
00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:27,464
Hey. Come on.

499
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:30,008
I told you I would lift everything.

500
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:32,177
I just feel bad.

501
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:36,223
You’re good at planning.

502
00:29:36,848 --> 00:29:39,226
Do you want your son
to follow in your footsteps

503
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:41,061
when you injured your arm from this job?

504
00:29:41,144 --> 00:29:44,648
I injured my arm because I was overworking
myself to pay back my father’s debt.

505
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,027
He has to fulfill his military duty, too.

506
00:29:49,611 --> 00:29:51,697
Whenever I think about him,
I can’t get any sleep.

507
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,573
I can’t support him much longer.

508
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:56,285
What? Ae-suk is working, too.

509
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:59,204
And I can’t let her keep working there.
She brags about making money.

510
00:29:59,288 --> 00:30:00,914
Rightfully so.

511
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:03,208
You should treat her like a queen.

512
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:04,376
You punk.

513
00:30:12,926 --> 00:30:14,553
I’m leaving!

514
00:30:14,636 --> 00:30:15,846
Wait.

515
00:30:19,057 --> 00:30:20,934
Let me pay you for overtime.

516
00:30:21,935 --> 00:30:22,811
It’s okay.

517
00:30:22,894 --> 00:30:26,231
Why? I put in enough money.
It’s 50,000 won.

518
00:30:26,315 --> 00:30:29,276
My daily fee is 100,000 won.
I only hand-washed a shirt.

519
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,986
I stopped you from going home.

520
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:33,071
I want to pay you for your time.
That's all.

521
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:34,906
I said it’s fine.

522
00:30:36,825 --> 00:30:37,868
Hello, ma’am!

523
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:40,329
Hi, Hae-hyo. It’s been a while.

524
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:41,580
You’ve gotten more handsome.

525
00:30:41,663 --> 00:30:43,582
You look more beautiful, too.

526
00:30:43,665 --> 00:30:45,459
I never saw you because I come home late.

527
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:47,336
Hye-jun is always late these days.

528
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:49,671
He won’t tell me what he’s up to, either.

529
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:52,424
-But he talks to you all about it, right?
-Of course.

530
00:30:52,507 --> 00:30:55,510
I tell Hye-jun everything including things
I keep from my mom.

531
00:30:57,637 --> 00:30:59,556
What is it that you're keeping from me?

532
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:01,933
I didn’t know you were here, Mom.

533
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:03,560
I’m late. I’ll get going now.

534
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:05,604
-Bye, ma’am.
-Bye.

535
00:31:07,022 --> 00:31:08,357
“Ma’am”?

536
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,192
How could you address her like that?

537
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:11,985
Why would you do that?

538
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:13,779
She’s Hye-jun's mom.
How should I call her?

539
00:31:13,862 --> 00:31:15,238
“Ae-suk”.

540
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:18,158
Mom, instead of pretending
to be young superficially,

541
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:19,659
think like one with an open mind.

542
00:31:19,743 --> 00:31:22,245
Stop looking down on her
with your absurd idea of hierarchy.

543
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:24,456
I never did such a thing.

544
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:27,376
And what aren’t you telling me?

545
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:30,003
Why do you tell Hye-jun but not me?

546
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,425
Don't tell me you're seeing someone.

547
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:39,137
At this rate, you’ll be writing
a movie on it.

548
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:41,264
<i>The Stalker.</i>

549
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:47,813
Hey, what about dinner?

550
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:50,273
You have a fashion show tomorrow.
I’ll get you a salad.

551
00:31:50,357 --> 00:31:51,525
You’re so creepy!

552
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:53,777
Stop stalking me!

553
00:31:54,444 --> 00:31:55,695
Don't get fresh with me.

554
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:58,824
Do you think you got here all on your own?

555
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:00,784
What do you mean?

556
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:04,579
Why are you looking at me like that?

557
00:32:06,873 --> 00:32:09,334
I want to show people
that I got here all on my own.

558
00:32:09,418 --> 00:32:10,877
I want you to respect that.

559
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:13,088
I completely respect that.

560
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:14,423
So don’t worry.

561
00:32:22,347 --> 00:32:25,016
<i>-Ma'am.
-It's Kim I-yeong.</i>

562
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,728
I really hate it
when you address me like that.

563
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:30,730
But I can't call you by your name.

564
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:33,733
This is for your wife.

565
00:32:35,277 --> 00:32:36,403
Thank you.

566
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,157
I’m pushing for Hae-hyo,
but the director won’t budge.

567
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,325
If you say that
as soon as I give you a present,

568
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:44,744
it looks like I'm bribing you.

569
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:47,747
But then, the world is
all about give and take.

570
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:50,792
By the time Hae-hyo becomes a star,
half the credit goes to you.

571
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:53,128
Only half?

572
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:55,714
I should work harder.

573
00:34:03,573 --> 00:34:05,784
MILITARY DRAFT NOTICE

574
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,619
RECIPIENT
SA HYE-JUN

575
00:34:10,872 --> 00:34:12,666
-Ae-suk.
-Yes.

576
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:16,294
You’re so early. I didn’t even start yet.

577
00:34:16,378 --> 00:34:18,255
I came early, so I could help.

578
00:34:18,338 --> 00:34:21,925
After a full day of doing house chores
at someone else's house,

579
00:34:22,008 --> 00:34:25,095
you come home and have to cook a feast.
Children are such hassles.

580
00:34:25,178 --> 00:34:27,973
You're right. Children are such hassles.

581
00:34:28,473 --> 00:34:30,433
Has she been quiet lately?

582
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:35,021
She throws a fit once or twice a year.
But she’s been quiet these days.

583
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:36,690
She ought to.

584
00:34:36,773 --> 00:34:37,899
She begged you

585
00:34:37,983 --> 00:34:40,652
to come back after you quit.
That's why you went back there.

586
00:34:40,735 --> 00:34:42,779
She just got used to me.

587
00:34:42,862 --> 00:34:45,073
I’m sure she can find someone else
if she wanted.

588
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:47,867
Stop being so humble.

589
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:52,914
What is this?

590
00:34:54,249 --> 00:34:55,959
Did Hye-jun get the draft notice?

591
00:34:58,253 --> 00:35:00,589
There will be blood today.

592
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:11,474
Are you going home after this?

593
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:12,684
Yes. What's up?

594
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:16,062
What are you hiding at home?
You’re always eager to go home.

595
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:17,981
How about pork belly at my house?

596
00:35:18,064 --> 00:35:20,066
I love you, Jeong-ha.

597
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,610
Goodness.

598
00:35:21,693 --> 00:35:22,736
-Clean up.
-I love you.

599
00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:24,904
-I love you.
-What are you girls laughing about?

600
00:35:26,197 --> 00:35:27,198
-Jeong-ha.
-Yes?

601
00:35:27,282 --> 00:35:30,201
Do you want to go
to the Homme fashion show tomorrow?

602
00:35:30,285 --> 00:35:32,579
I know it’s your day off,
so it’s fine if you don’t want to.

603
00:35:32,662 --> 00:35:33,913
No, that sounds great.

604
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:37,125
Jin-ju can do it by herself,
but it will be too much work for her.

605
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,543
Thank you.

606
00:35:38,627 --> 00:35:40,462
Thank you. I’ll try my best!

607
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:42,380
I know you try your best.

608
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,424
-Just do a good job.
-Okay.

609
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:46,718
-I'm leaving now.
-Goodnight, ma’am!

610
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:48,178
Goodnight!

611
00:35:50,597 --> 00:35:53,224
I guess you and Hye-jun
are destined to meet!

612
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:55,018
-Oh, my gosh!
-No way.

613
00:35:55,101 --> 00:35:56,269
Your face is red.

614
00:35:56,353 --> 00:35:57,896
-No!
-Goodness.

615
00:36:06,738 --> 00:36:08,823
This is for Table Six.
And this is for Table Eight.

616
00:36:08,907 --> 00:36:10,575
-Okay.
-Tables Six and Eight.

617
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:11,660
Okay.

618
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:14,120
Here you go.

619
00:36:15,664 --> 00:36:16,915
Here you go.

620
00:36:16,998 --> 00:36:17,999
Excuse me.

621
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,085
What do you need?

622
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:21,670
You're so handsome.

623
00:36:21,753 --> 00:36:24,255
-Thank you.
-We come here to see you.

624
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:25,715
Do you want more vegetables?

625
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:26,675
-Yes, please.
-Yes.

626
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,388
You're so popular.

627
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,687
Why didn’t you go to my house?

628
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,729
So we can go together.

629
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:41,940
-Two servings of pork belly?
-And <i>bibim naengmyeon</i>.

630
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:50,281
We need to start leveling soon.

631
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:52,325
-What should I do?
-It's not ready yet?

632
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:54,494
Honey, come and take the plates!

633
00:36:54,577 --> 00:36:55,745
Okay.

634
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:57,914
I’ll do it. You’re a guest. Stay here.

635
00:36:57,997 --> 00:37:01,167
No, we’re not. Are we guests here?
We’re having this meal thanks to you.

636
00:37:01,251 --> 00:37:03,378
Let him do it. He’s better at it.

637
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:05,296
He’s right, Dad. Let Gyeong-jun do it.

638
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,673
Now that you say it, I don’t want to.

639
00:37:06,756 --> 00:37:09,759
You're always like that when people ask.

640
00:37:09,843 --> 00:37:11,010
That’s how everyone is.

641
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:12,887
Same here. What about you, Yeong-nam?

642
00:37:13,513 --> 00:37:14,973
I wouldn’t want to do something

643
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:16,349
if someone orders me to do it.

644
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:18,893
That’s how we all feel.
We’re all the same.

645
00:37:18,977 --> 00:37:21,229
I told you to get the plate.
Why are you still here?

646
00:37:21,312 --> 00:37:23,273
-You’re so chatty.
-I’m coming. I’m sorry.

647
00:37:23,356 --> 00:37:25,442
Why would you do that?
You’re the man of the hour.

648
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:26,651
Honey, you do it.

649
00:37:26,735 --> 00:37:28,653
Don’t do anything.
You’ll only cause trouble.

650
00:37:28,737 --> 00:37:31,531
I agree.
“Why are you only making me do it?

651
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:34,743
The world has changed now.
Is it because I’m a woman?

652
00:37:34,826 --> 00:37:37,537
That’s anachronistic thinking!”
I’d rather do it myself.

653
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,414
Is that true, Jin-ri?

654
00:37:39,497 --> 00:37:43,793
Yes. I’m very interested in building
my own life and living independently.

655
00:37:43,877 --> 00:37:46,337
You sound very smart.
Your father must be happy.

656
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:48,214
Try living with her, then.

657
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:50,467
Gyeong-jun, you're good at this.

658
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,926
Honey, you should do it.

659
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,178
Give me a bigger one.

660
00:37:53,261 --> 00:37:54,554
Goodness.

661
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:55,680
-Take this, then.
-Okay.

662
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:02,145
Should I go out or not?

663
00:38:02,687 --> 00:38:05,315
I should go out before they come for me.

664
00:38:05,398 --> 00:38:08,610
They might think I'm a hassle.

665
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:12,280
Let me see.

666
00:38:12,363 --> 00:38:13,615
WE ROOT FOR YOUR EVERY MOMENT

667
00:38:13,698 --> 00:38:16,367
<i>-Come here. Gyeong-jun, sit down.
-Okay.</i>

668
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:17,744
Goodness.

669
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:19,662
The meal is ready now.

670
00:38:19,746 --> 00:38:22,624
Okay. I was exercising.

671
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:25,668
I didn’t ask.

672
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,589
I respect your privacy.

673
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,760
Goodness.

674
00:38:33,843 --> 00:38:35,720
So the entire neighborhood knows

675
00:38:36,805 --> 00:38:39,641
that I’m walking on eggshells.

676
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:00,578
Until when will you waste your life?

677
00:39:00,662 --> 00:39:02,038
What do you mean?

678
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:04,624
I thought about what I could do for you.

679
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:08,253
Why don’t you work here
as a manager instead of a part-timer?

680
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:10,964
You know that
I can’t work here permanently.

681
00:39:11,047 --> 00:39:13,383
How long do you think you’ll stay young?

682
00:39:13,466 --> 00:39:15,760
Learn the business and save up
some money. It's a nice deal.

683
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:19,430
If you do well, I'll let you take over
after your military service.

684
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:21,224
Thank you for the offer.

685
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:24,644
Come on. Are you turning it down
even before you've given it some thought?

686
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:26,271
I'm sorry.

687
00:39:26,354 --> 00:39:28,565
Take advice from people
who are older than you.

688
00:39:29,107 --> 00:39:32,193
I'm speaking from experience.
The elders always have a point.

689
00:39:32,777 --> 00:39:34,404
I used to listen to them, too.

690
00:39:35,196 --> 00:39:39,868
But I've learned it the hard way
that people only look out for themselves.

691
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,746
Hey, I thought about
giving you the restaurant.

692
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,665
How is that looking out for myself?

693
00:39:46,332 --> 00:39:50,044
Hye-jun, I didn't peg you
to be so cynical.

694
00:39:50,128 --> 00:39:53,798
I wasn't talking about you.
I was making a general statement.

695
00:39:56,134 --> 00:39:57,635
-Right?
-Yes.

696
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,512
There's no way you'd see me that way.

697
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:01,848
So you should listen to the elders.

698
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:03,474
I want you to reconsider.

699
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,770
Why aren't you answering me?

700
00:40:08,313 --> 00:40:09,939
Okay.

701
00:40:10,023 --> 00:40:11,774
Okay. Good work today.

702
00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:23,161
-Bye.
-Bye.

703
00:40:23,244 --> 00:40:24,370
Good work today.

704
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:30,043
What took you so long to change?

705
00:40:32,086 --> 00:40:33,212
Did the owner say something?

706
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:36,132
I have a lot on my mind.

707
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:38,927
What should we do on a day like this?

708
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,345
What should we do?

709
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:43,723
No.

710
00:40:43,806 --> 00:40:45,892
No way! I’m not doing that!

711
00:40:45,975 --> 00:40:48,436
-I'm not doing that! I won't!
-You don't have to.

712
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,980
I told you I won't do it!

713
00:40:51,064 --> 00:40:52,857
Gosh.

714
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:59,447
Hey, stop him! Hurry!

715
00:41:03,868 --> 00:41:04,786
Why are you here?

716
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,372
I live in this neighborhood.
Is it a problem?

717
00:41:08,206 --> 00:41:09,999
Of course, not.

718
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:13,586
Won Hae-hyo, that traitor.

719
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,296
I called him to stop Hye-jun from running.

720
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,675
Wait up for me, you annoyingly tall jerks!

721
00:41:18,758 --> 00:41:20,301
He always talks when he runs.

722
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:21,844
I guess he can't run without talking.

723
00:41:34,107 --> 00:41:37,610
Gyeong-jun, does it mean you’ll help us
if we want to take out a loan?

724
00:41:37,694 --> 00:41:40,446
I mostly handle companies,
so I don’t know much about that.

725
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,489
Even if you did,

726
00:41:41,572 --> 00:41:44,409
you must not do favors for your friends.

727
00:41:44,492 --> 00:41:47,120
I’m sure he can handle it himself.
Why would you say that?

728
00:41:48,121 --> 00:41:50,665
You can never be too sure.

729
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,212
All right. Let’s raise our glasses again.

730
00:41:56,295 --> 00:41:58,006
Yeong-nam, why don't you give a toast?

731
00:41:58,089 --> 00:41:59,674
I don’t have anything to say.

732
00:41:59,757 --> 00:42:01,509
Of course, you do.

733
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:03,678
Your son grew into a fine young man.

734
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:05,596
If my son had turned out
to be this successful,

735
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,142
I’d be bragging about him
even to my distant relatives.

736
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:15,481
Sir, you just dissed him.

737
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:18,276
What? “Diss”? What’s that?

738
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:21,738
To borrow our term, it means to criticize.

739
00:42:26,868 --> 00:42:27,910
Jin-ri.

740
00:42:27,994 --> 00:42:30,913
You should elaborate.
That way, he won’t misunderstand.

741
00:42:30,997 --> 00:42:32,874
I didn't misunderstand.
He clearly dissed me.

742
00:42:32,957 --> 00:42:35,293
-Honey.
-It's true.

743
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:37,295
I’m his son. Aren't I?

744
00:42:37,378 --> 00:42:40,465
If I had been successful,
he would have bragged about me,

745
00:42:40,548 --> 00:42:42,258
but he can’t because I’m a nobody.

746
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:46,137
Gosh. Respect.

747
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,389
You’re so dope, Mr. Sa. Awesome.

748
00:42:49,265 --> 00:42:50,975
Jin-ri, what’s wrong with you?

749
00:42:52,143 --> 00:42:55,104
Yeong-nam, she’s gotten weird
after starting college.

750
00:42:55,188 --> 00:42:56,939
She only speaks the truth.

751
00:42:57,023 --> 00:42:58,191
Goodness.

752
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:01,360
Fine. It's a good day.
Let's laugh about it.

753
00:43:01,986 --> 00:43:03,362
Everyone, raise your glasses.

754
00:43:03,446 --> 00:43:05,698
Let’s congratulate my oldest son
for getting a job.

755
00:43:05,782 --> 00:43:07,283
Jin-ri, raise your glass.

756
00:43:07,366 --> 00:43:10,286
I’ll pour you a drink
for making me laugh today.

757
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:11,370
-Here.
-Thank you.

758
00:43:12,163 --> 00:43:14,040
I wish Jin-u and Hye-jun were here, too.

759
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:15,917
-Yes.
-Cheers.

760
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,752
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

761
00:43:17,835 --> 00:43:20,046
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

762
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:38,689
I bet people with bad karma
in previous lives become models.

763
00:43:38,773 --> 00:43:40,691
You can’t even eat what you want.

764
00:43:41,484 --> 00:43:43,694
Life isn't just about eating.

765
00:43:43,778 --> 00:43:46,155
To some people, it is.

766
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:47,865
-Me?
-But we don’t tease them about it.

767
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:50,701
We don’t tease them. We respect them.

768
00:43:51,536 --> 00:43:53,663
Look at your teamwork.

769
00:43:58,668 --> 00:44:00,086
That's so cool.

770
00:44:00,169 --> 00:44:02,171
-Hey, girl!
-She might scold you.

771
00:44:02,255 --> 00:44:03,714
Why?

772
00:44:08,052 --> 00:44:09,262
Yes.

773
00:44:12,974 --> 00:44:15,184
Guys, get in!

774
00:44:15,268 --> 00:44:16,394
I’m bored.

775
00:44:16,477 --> 00:44:18,271
-No!
-I’m getting in.

776
00:44:18,354 --> 00:44:20,022
I’m in! Move out of my way.

777
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,569
Does he even have any pride?

778
00:44:25,528 --> 00:44:27,655
What’s the point? She’s your sister.

779
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:30,449
By the way, she grew up a lot.

780
00:44:30,533 --> 00:44:31,450
She’s past that point.

781
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:33,619
She stopped growing.
Now, she’s getting old.

782
00:44:34,954 --> 00:44:36,330
Bye, guys.

783
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,749
Look at him all happy.

784
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:42,044
Let him be.
She’ll leave him in front of my house.

785
00:44:44,547 --> 00:44:47,133
Looking at Hae-na makes me
think time is fair.

786
00:44:49,176 --> 00:44:51,470
I thought I was the only one getting old,
but she is, too.

787
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:55,725
How can time be the only fair thing
in this world?

788
00:44:58,853 --> 00:44:59,979
What's going on?

789
00:45:01,439 --> 00:45:03,107
The reality has been

790
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,318
hitting me hard.

791
00:45:12,825 --> 00:45:13,868
Get off.

792
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:14,911
-Get off?
-Get off.

793
00:45:14,994 --> 00:45:16,454
-Really?
-Really.

794
00:45:17,538 --> 00:45:19,081
-Don’t regret it.
-I will

795
00:45:20,082 --> 00:45:21,208
regret it.

796
00:45:23,961 --> 00:45:26,130
Let’s go somewhere else.

797
00:45:26,213 --> 00:45:27,256
No.

798
00:45:28,966 --> 00:45:30,718
If you don’t want to, I don’t want to.

799
00:45:32,303 --> 00:45:33,763
I like your attitude.

800
00:45:34,263 --> 00:45:35,973
-I should give you a reward.
-What?

801
00:45:37,475 --> 00:45:38,601
Wait.

802
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:50,196
Now, tell me.

803
00:45:50,863 --> 00:45:52,448
What gave you a hard time today?

804
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:55,743
If I talk about it, it’ll upset me again.

805
00:45:57,453 --> 00:45:59,830
Tell me when talking about it
doesn't upset you.

806
00:46:01,874 --> 00:46:03,668
Did people from the movie audition
call back?

807
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,253
No. Did you get a call?

808
00:46:06,337 --> 00:46:08,756
No. I was wondering if you had gotten it.

809
00:46:11,926 --> 00:46:13,344
Do you think one of us will get it?

810
00:46:13,427 --> 00:46:14,428
Yes.

811
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:16,347
I agree.

812
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:19,225
If you get it,
I’ll still congratulate you.

813
00:46:19,308 --> 00:46:20,559
Of course.

814
00:46:21,394 --> 00:46:22,770
I’ll do the same.

815
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:27,858
But if I don’t get it this time,
I’ll join the military.

816
00:46:28,442 --> 00:46:30,027
I think I tried enough.

817
00:46:32,446 --> 00:46:34,073
We were supposed to go together.

818
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:36,617
You know what people say.

819
00:46:36,701 --> 00:46:38,452
They say when you get old,
your friends change

820
00:46:39,286 --> 00:46:40,579
depending on how much money you have.

821
00:46:40,663 --> 00:46:43,249
That's not true for us. We knew
things were different in the first place.

822
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:46,502
If we change,

823
00:46:46,585 --> 00:46:48,087
it doesn’t mean it’s about the money.

824
00:46:49,046 --> 00:46:50,339
It means we lost our innocence.

825
00:46:57,096 --> 00:46:58,472
Why are you staring at me?

826
00:46:58,556 --> 00:46:59,432
I love you, Hye-jun.

827
00:47:00,307 --> 00:47:01,142
Stop it.

828
00:47:02,226 --> 00:47:04,603
Stop it. Hey, quit it. Come on.

829
00:47:04,687 --> 00:47:06,272
You're crazy.

830
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,861
I’m going to do it one of these days!

831
00:47:12,486 --> 00:47:13,821
Bye.

832
00:47:13,904 --> 00:47:15,031
Bye.

833
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:20,119
I look completely fried.

834
00:47:20,202 --> 00:47:21,245
What a line.

835
00:47:21,328 --> 00:47:22,913
Wait. Should I stay quiet?

836
00:47:22,997 --> 00:47:25,082
-It’s okay. I can edit it out later.
-Okay.

837
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:28,836
I’m sure there were times when you were
surprised to see yourselves after work.

838
00:47:28,919 --> 00:47:31,297
But you have plans after work.

839
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,965
Don’t worry. You can fix your makeup.

840
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:35,760
I’ll teach you a simple method.

841
00:47:37,928 --> 00:47:39,346
Don’t I look much better?

842
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:42,975
Remember my tip.
Apply glitters under the eyes.

843
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:45,061
Then, use eyeliner and a lip tint.

844
00:47:45,644 --> 00:47:46,645
Ta-da.

845
00:47:47,229 --> 00:47:49,231
I’m meeting Hye-jun tomorrow!

846
00:47:49,315 --> 00:47:50,483
I’m hungry!

847
00:47:50,566 --> 00:47:52,359
Hurry.

848
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:06,916
Can I eat now?

849
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:07,958
Dig in.

850
00:48:17,176 --> 00:48:18,552
I totally approve of this mix!

851
00:48:18,636 --> 00:48:22,890
The delicious juice of the meat
and the savory flavor of the cheese!

852
00:48:22,973 --> 00:48:25,142
And kimchi neutralizes the greasiness!

853
00:48:25,226 --> 00:48:28,229
After this, I’ll make you fried rice
with <i>kkakdugi</i>. It’s really good.

854
00:48:28,312 --> 00:48:31,315
When I first met you, I thought
you were such a cheapskate.

855
00:48:31,398 --> 00:48:33,442
You always wanted to eat at your house.

856
00:48:33,526 --> 00:48:35,277
That’s how I bought this house.

857
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:38,114
Of course, the bank owns
most of the house for now.

858
00:48:38,864 --> 00:48:40,366
How could you take out a 30-year loan

859
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:42,451
when you don't even know
what might happen tomorrow?

860
00:48:42,535 --> 00:48:43,828
I don’t get you.

861
00:48:43,911 --> 00:48:46,163
That’s because you never had to live
without a house.

862
00:48:46,914 --> 00:48:49,250
Owning a house gives you
a sense of stability.

863
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:52,086
That’s why I even named
my YouTube channel, I Like Stability.

864
00:48:52,169 --> 00:48:54,004
If you want stability, get married.

865
00:48:54,088 --> 00:48:55,131
No, I won't.

866
00:48:55,214 --> 00:48:57,591
Will you say no even if Sa Hye-jun asks?

867
00:48:57,675 --> 00:49:00,219
Even he can’t change my belief.

868
00:49:00,302 --> 00:49:01,428
Then, how are you his fan?

869
00:49:02,847 --> 00:49:05,766
Only the thought of love makes you happy.

870
00:49:06,267 --> 00:49:08,561
I don't want to be in love,
but I want to be happy.

871
00:49:08,644 --> 00:49:10,729
Love and alcohol go hand in hand.
Do you have alcohol at home?

872
00:49:10,813 --> 00:49:13,107
No. I don't drink
when I have work the next day.

873
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,692
You're doing everything you want.

874
00:49:14,775 --> 00:49:16,402
Yes, I am.

875
00:49:16,485 --> 00:49:20,030
When I quit the company,
I decided to live for myself.

876
00:49:20,114 --> 00:49:23,075
You should live for yourself, too.
Our country is too family-oriented.

877
00:49:34,628 --> 00:49:41,552
HAPPINESS DAY BY DAY

878
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,569
SA YEONG-NAM

879
00:50:03,073 --> 00:50:05,284
Look at you humming.

880
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,828
You must have had a good time.

881
00:50:07,912 --> 00:50:08,996
I was working.

882
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:10,539
Working?

883
00:50:10,623 --> 00:50:12,249
What on earth are you up to?

884
00:50:16,045 --> 00:50:17,338
What are you doing?

885
00:50:17,421 --> 00:50:19,423
So you don’t want to answer me?

886
00:50:21,342 --> 00:50:23,928
I’m making a new door
for Gyeong-jun’s room.

887
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:04,760
You're home.

888
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:10,641
Hye-jun.

889
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:15,145
I need to talk to you.

890
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:16,563
What is it?

891
00:51:16,647 --> 00:51:17,856
Your dad can’t know.

892
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,442
Just tell me. I’m really tired today.

893
00:51:20,526 --> 00:51:21,860
It won’t take long.

894
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:31,120
MILITARY DRAFT NOTICE

895
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:33,998
What are you going to do?

896
00:51:34,957 --> 00:51:36,292
You have to go this time.

897
00:51:36,959 --> 00:51:38,085
I should.

898
00:51:38,168 --> 00:51:39,586
I’m glad to hear that.

899
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:43,716
But Mom,
I auditioned for a movie this time.

900
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:47,052
If I get that role,
I’ll think of it as my last chance

901
00:51:47,136 --> 00:51:48,762
and postpone it one last time.

902
00:51:48,846 --> 00:51:51,557
Just go.
You have to fulfill your duty anyway.

903
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,100
Why are you eavesdropping?

904
00:51:53,183 --> 00:51:55,269
I can hear everything in this small house.

905
00:51:55,352 --> 00:51:57,813
Don’t butt in my life. Just live your own.

906
00:51:57,896 --> 00:52:01,317
I’m already living a good life. You know
that you’re the burden of our family.

907
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,776
Why would you say that?

908
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,611
You don’t say it,
but I bet you agree with me.

909
00:52:04,695 --> 00:52:06,405
I only said it out loud.

910
00:52:06,488 --> 00:52:07,656
What…

911
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,366
Is that true?

912
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,493
That’s not true.

913
00:52:11,577 --> 00:52:14,330
My own family was judging me
behind my back?

914
00:52:15,456 --> 00:52:18,459
Hey, everyone gets judged.

915
00:52:18,959 --> 00:52:20,210
You think we're any different?

916
00:52:20,294 --> 00:52:23,547
Do the same standards apply to everyone?
Everyone is different.

917
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:26,717
Gyeong-jun,
I think you have a nasty personality.

918
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,761
I agree that you got a job
because you are smart,

919
00:52:28,844 --> 00:52:30,512
but what have you done for the family

920
00:52:30,596 --> 00:52:32,473
after getting a job with your smart brain?

921
00:52:33,307 --> 00:52:34,850
Yes, he contributed to the family.

922
00:52:35,642 --> 00:52:38,020
Why are you butting in?

923
00:52:38,103 --> 00:52:39,813
What's wrong with you?

924
00:52:39,897 --> 00:52:41,148
It's nothing.

925
00:52:41,231 --> 00:52:42,483
Go to your room.

926
00:52:45,402 --> 00:52:48,447
It’s not nothing. Because you keep
babying him, you’re spoiling him.

927
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,783
I got it. That's enough.

928
00:52:52,993 --> 00:52:54,828
-You’re home.
-Yes.

929
00:52:54,912 --> 00:52:56,163
Did you eat?

930
00:52:56,246 --> 00:52:58,040
I did. What about you?

931
00:52:58,123 --> 00:53:00,626
I did. What happened to your face?

932
00:53:00,709 --> 00:53:02,294
It's nothing.

933
00:53:03,379 --> 00:53:06,256
I heard the draft notice came.
Why did you hide that?

934
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,342
Hide what? I just saw it, too.

935
00:53:08,425 --> 00:53:09,760
Anyway, go to the military now.

936
00:53:09,843 --> 00:53:11,970
How can I go now? It’s night.

937
00:53:12,054 --> 00:53:14,264
You know I didn't mean literally now.

938
00:53:14,348 --> 00:53:15,599
What will you do with your life?

939
00:53:15,682 --> 00:53:18,018
Will you keep wasting your good days
for a dead end?

940
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:20,270
Let me ask you a question, too.

941
00:53:21,313 --> 00:53:23,273
Do you also consider me
the burden of the family?

942
00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:28,195
-Why are you asking me that?
-I want to judge my family, too.

943
00:53:28,278 --> 00:53:29,696
I thought our family was special,

944
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,117
but if you have been judging me
behind my back, I should change my stance.

945
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,701
You are no different than strangers.

946
00:53:34,785 --> 00:53:37,871
We're talking about the military
and your future. Don't change the subject.

947
00:53:37,955 --> 00:53:39,873
I need to know if you are
truly concerned for me

948
00:53:39,957 --> 00:53:41,792
or if you’re worried
that I'll be a burden.

949
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:44,128
I must know to answer accordingly.

950
00:53:44,211 --> 00:53:46,797
That’s no way to talk to your own father.

951
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,550
I’m telling you this, so you could live
a good life, not a bad one.

952
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:51,260
You worked as a model long enough.

953
00:53:51,343 --> 00:53:53,804
At first, you liked it,
but look where it got you now.

954
00:53:53,887 --> 00:53:55,889
You earn just enough for your allowance.

955
00:53:56,557 --> 00:54:00,102
You don’t need to look further.
Just look at your grandpa.

956
00:54:00,185 --> 00:54:01,562
Take a good look at him.

957
00:54:01,645 --> 00:54:03,772
When he was young,
people complimented on his good looks

958
00:54:03,856 --> 00:54:05,315
and said he ought to be on TV.

959
00:54:05,399 --> 00:54:06,984
People kept encouraging him.

960
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:09,319
That got him thinking
he could be a singer or an actor.

961
00:54:09,403 --> 00:54:11,196
That’s how he got there.

962
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,449
Hye-jun is different.

963
00:54:13,532 --> 00:54:15,451
Why do you keep comparing him to me?

964
00:54:15,534 --> 00:54:17,202
How is he any different?

965
00:54:17,286 --> 00:54:19,455
I think he’s just like you
when you were young.

966
00:54:19,538 --> 00:54:22,374
If you didn't get scammed
with all of my savings,

967
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:25,210
-we wouldn’t be living like this.
-I know. I'm sorry.

968
00:54:25,294 --> 00:54:27,504
That’s why I don’t even squeak.

969
00:54:28,005 --> 00:54:30,757
I’m the burden of my family.
It’s not you, Hye-jun.

970
00:54:32,718 --> 00:54:35,053
Why do you keep protecting him?

971
00:54:35,137 --> 00:54:38,223
Whenever I see his face,
I feel so frustrated.

972
00:54:38,307 --> 00:54:40,392
Whenever I see him trying
to become an actor like you,

973
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:42,352
my heart stops beating.

974
00:54:42,436 --> 00:54:44,104
That’s enough. Stop it.

975
00:54:44,188 --> 00:54:45,939
-Darn it.
-You should get some sleep.

976
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:48,692
How do you expect me to sleep
when you have upset me?

977
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:50,736
What's wrong with you?

978
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:52,070
Stop it.

979
00:54:52,154 --> 00:54:55,324
Why should I stop? He turned out like that
because you keep protecting him.

980
00:54:55,407 --> 00:54:56,909
He can hear you.

981
00:54:56,992 --> 00:54:59,786
So what? He should face reality.

982
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:02,456
You give me no choice.
Honey come here. You, come with me.

983
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:03,582
Gosh.

984
00:55:06,126 --> 00:55:07,211
Goodness.

985
00:55:09,296 --> 00:55:12,049
-Mom. I--
-Stop. Let's talk here.

986
00:55:12,132 --> 00:55:15,135
My father and you are the ones
ruining Hye-jun's life.

987
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:17,095
He should learn to face hardships in life.

988
00:55:17,179 --> 00:55:18,263
Mom.

989
00:55:19,598 --> 00:55:20,974
This is his turning point.

990
00:55:21,058 --> 00:55:23,727
If he makes a wrong decision,
he'll turn out like Grandpa.

991
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:25,562
What's wrong with your grandfather?

992
00:55:25,646 --> 00:55:27,689
Must I really spell it out for you?

993
00:55:27,773 --> 00:55:30,359
He's warmhearted and has a gentle soul.

994
00:55:30,442 --> 00:55:31,693
Goodness.

995
00:55:31,777 --> 00:55:34,112
-It's so fake. Do you think she meant it?
-I doubt it.

996
00:55:34,196 --> 00:55:36,073
So what do you want to do, then?

997
00:55:36,156 --> 00:55:38,492
He's already having a tough time.
What are you bothering him?

998
00:55:38,575 --> 00:55:42,454
How could he think of making a living
by just walking on some platform?

999
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:47,000
When he was on TV, you used to
brag about him to your friends.

1000
00:55:47,084 --> 00:55:48,752
I thought he was going to be famous.

1001
00:55:48,835 --> 00:55:50,546
I also had a pipe dream, back then.

1002
00:55:51,046 --> 00:55:52,506
Let bygone be bygone.

1003
00:55:52,589 --> 00:55:53,840
We must face reality.

1004
00:55:53,924 --> 00:55:56,593
Protecting him won't solve anything.

1005
00:55:56,677 --> 00:55:58,428
You do live up to my expectations.

1006
00:55:58,512 --> 00:56:01,515
You take after me.
You're so good at taking care of yourself.

1007
00:56:01,598 --> 00:56:05,394
Anyway, we must wait
until Hye-jun makes his own decision.

1008
00:56:06,395 --> 00:56:08,772
We always gave you a chance
to make your own decisions.

1009
00:56:08,855 --> 00:56:10,774
So your brother deserves the same chance.

1010
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:12,025
Goodness.

1011
00:57:07,831 --> 00:57:11,001
<i>I’m sure there were times when you were
surprised to see yourselves after work.</i>

1012
00:57:11,084 --> 00:57:13,462
<i>But you have plans after work.</i>

1013
00:57:13,545 --> 00:57:15,339
<i>Don’t worry. You can fix your makeup.</i>

1014
00:57:19,551 --> 00:57:21,929
OBSCURE

1015
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:30,729
<i>I'm finally going to meet him tomorrow.</i>

1016
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:32,189
<i>I'm nervous.</i>

1017
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,816
<i>I'll tell him</i>

1018
00:57:36,068 --> 00:57:38,195
<i>that I've been his fan for a long time</i>

1019
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:39,905
<i>and I root for him.</i>

1020
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:06,431
NEW POST

1021
00:58:06,515 --> 00:58:09,267
NIGHT MAKEUP, CHEESE PORK BELLY, EXCITED

1022
00:58:09,351 --> 00:58:13,480
NIGHT MAKEUP, CHEESE PORK BELLY, EXCITED

1023
00:58:30,614 --> 00:58:32,908
Square your shoulders. Gaze intensely.

1024
00:58:37,037 --> 00:58:38,580
Guys in the back, keep your distances.

1025
00:58:43,126 --> 00:58:44,753
Switch the first and the second models.

1026
00:58:46,922 --> 00:58:48,257
Great. Walk with more rhythm.

1027
00:59:03,438 --> 00:59:05,065
Great, Hye-jun.

1028
00:59:13,615 --> 00:59:14,658
Sir.

1029
00:59:15,951 --> 00:59:16,994
Okay.

1030
00:59:20,372 --> 00:59:22,040
Gaze ahead. Gaze farther.

1031
00:59:24,084 --> 00:59:25,669
Try to look nicer than that.

1032
00:59:47,149 --> 00:59:49,234
Yes, where is that?

1033
00:59:56,908 --> 00:59:59,202
Jeong-ha, can you organize mine, too?

1034
00:59:59,286 --> 01:00:00,454
Okay.

1035
01:00:08,754 --> 01:00:09,796
Let’s get our makeup done.

1036
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,881
Okay.

1037
01:00:17,262 --> 01:00:19,264
-Hello.
-Hi.

1038
01:00:36,031 --> 01:00:38,408
Mr. Won Hae-hyo, this way.

1039
01:00:38,492 --> 01:00:39,826
Okay.

1040
01:00:44,915 --> 01:00:47,250
I’ve heard a lot about you
from the professor.

1041
01:00:47,334 --> 01:00:50,504
-"Professor"?
-Professor Kim I-yeong.

1042
01:00:50,587 --> 01:00:52,339
She stopped teaching a long time ago.

1043
01:00:52,422 --> 01:00:56,676
Is that so? Well, once a professor,
always a professor.

1044
01:01:08,939 --> 01:01:10,315
Why didn’t you call my name?

1045
01:01:11,191 --> 01:01:12,526
Oh, I see.

1046
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,324
Let’s nourish your skin first.

1047
01:01:35,799 --> 01:01:36,883
I'm sorry.

1048
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:38,385
It's all right.

1049
01:01:53,191 --> 01:01:54,818
How come I don’t get a face pack?

1050
01:01:54,901 --> 01:01:56,736
You have good skin, so you don’t need it.

1051
01:02:37,777 --> 01:02:40,280
EFFORTLESS HAIRSTYLE AND MAKEUP

1052
01:03:51,184 --> 01:03:52,769
It’s done.

1053
01:03:52,852 --> 01:03:53,979
Thank you.

1054
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,274
The salon director is asking for you.

1055
01:03:59,651 --> 01:04:03,280
It’s almost done. But can I finish this up
after I briefly talk to her?

1056
01:04:03,363 --> 01:04:05,615
Sure. It’s fine. We have a lot of time.

1057
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:07,033
Thank you.

1058
01:04:09,744 --> 01:04:11,246
I’ll be out. Come out once you’re done.

1059
01:04:11,329 --> 01:04:13,331
Wait for me here.
She said it won’t take long.

1060
01:04:13,832 --> 01:04:16,209
I’m done with my makeup.
I feel bad taking up the spot.

1061
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,670
Can he stay here?

1062
01:04:20,505 --> 01:04:21,590
He can.

1063
01:04:26,803 --> 01:04:27,804
Yes, Mom.

1064
01:04:28,972 --> 01:04:30,640
What? You’re here? Why?

1065
01:04:30,724 --> 01:04:32,225
Can I sit in the chair?

1066
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:33,810
Yes.

1067
01:04:34,811 --> 01:04:36,104
You want me to come out now?

1068
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:38,607
But are you always this quiet?

1069
01:04:40,317 --> 01:04:43,028
-No.
-Okay.

1070
01:04:46,573 --> 01:04:48,617
I have to go out.
She has something for me.

1071
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,076
Go, then.

1072
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,244
What about this?

1073
01:04:52,287 --> 01:04:53,413
It's done. You can go.

1074
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:56,458
Gosh. My lips…

1075
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,960
Can you finish this up?

1076
01:05:01,671 --> 01:05:05,091
You're not my client. I can't do that.

1077
01:05:09,846 --> 01:05:10,972
Should I pick it up for you?

1078
01:05:11,848 --> 01:05:12,932
She wants me to come.

1079
01:05:15,769 --> 01:05:17,312
By the way, you're too cold.

1080
01:05:18,813 --> 01:05:22,400
It looks like you work at the same salon.
Do you have to divide clients?

1081
01:05:23,568 --> 01:05:25,278
I guess you guys aren’t on good terms.

1082
01:05:25,362 --> 01:05:26,404
No.

1083
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:29,366
Wait, no. That's not it.

1084
01:05:30,325 --> 01:05:32,410
Does she have a nasty temper?

1085
01:05:32,494 --> 01:05:35,789
If you were her, would you answer that?

1086
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:39,125
I'll do it.

1087
01:05:40,669 --> 01:05:41,961
I'll do it for you.

1088
01:05:44,506 --> 01:05:47,258
She’s not mean at all.

1089
01:05:47,342 --> 01:05:51,137
People say…
I’m not saying that’s everyone.

1090
01:05:51,221 --> 01:05:53,014
Some people say that

1091
01:05:53,098 --> 01:05:56,434
I’m not good
at making people feel comfortable.

1092
01:05:57,435 --> 01:05:58,937
I’m the opposite.

1093
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,231
People love me
because I make them feel so comfortable.

1094
01:06:01,856 --> 01:06:03,942
Yes. It’s not just people.

1095
01:06:04,025 --> 01:06:06,986
When the dogs see you,
they are so happy that they start barking.

1096
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,196
What?

1097
01:06:11,491 --> 01:06:12,742
Good dog. One more time.

1098
01:06:13,785 --> 01:06:14,786
Stop it.

1099
01:06:16,871 --> 01:06:20,500
So you always do this.
You always try to steal clients.

1100
01:06:21,584 --> 01:06:24,254
I thought it was a mistake last time.
You agree the first mistake is

1101
01:06:24,337 --> 01:06:27,006
considered unintentional,
but after that, it's a nasty habit.

1102
01:06:28,091 --> 01:06:30,385
It’s not what you think. The client--

1103
01:06:30,468 --> 01:06:34,264
I’m sorry. She and I made a promise.

1104
01:06:34,347 --> 01:06:37,892
I told her I would humiliate her
if this happens again.

1105
01:06:37,976 --> 01:06:39,894
I have to keep my promise.

1106
01:06:39,978 --> 01:06:40,937
-Well--
-No.

1107
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:44,107
You know if you side with her,
you’ll make it more difficult for her.

1108
01:06:47,193 --> 01:06:48,695
I'm sorry.

1109
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:52,907
People will think I’m the mean one here.

1110
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:54,993
"She should let it go.
Why is she doing that?"

1111
01:06:55,577 --> 01:06:59,205
But you know how evil you are.

1112
01:07:07,213 --> 01:07:09,257
I'll contour your face

1113
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:10,717
and do shading.

1114
01:07:51,925 --> 01:07:54,427
“I can’t believe I got this lucky.

1115
01:07:56,429 --> 01:07:59,516
This is such an exciting moment
of my life.

1116
01:08:00,225 --> 01:08:02,143
Living an honest life paid off.

1117
01:08:04,729 --> 01:08:08,233
I should be grateful.”
Scratch all of that. Damn it.

1118
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:13,196
But why was Hye-jun so handsome today?

1119
01:08:21,746 --> 01:08:25,834
Living an honest life doesn't mean
I'll be happy in life.

1120
01:08:29,128 --> 01:08:33,466
Nasty people who don’t care about others

1121
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:35,802
always win in this life.

1122
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:45,061
But I’m so glad
that I decided to be your fan.

1123
01:08:48,398 --> 01:08:49,566
Are you my fan?

1124
01:08:53,778 --> 01:08:54,696
What?

1125
01:09:13,047 --> 01:09:14,424
Do you like me?

1126
01:09:43,396 --> 01:09:50,677

RECORD OF YOUTH

1128
01:10:18,905 --> 01:10:20,239
<i>I was nervous.</i>

1129
01:10:20,323 --> 01:10:22,408
<i>Do you know how nervous I was?</i>

1130
01:10:22,492 --> 01:10:24,869
Hey, Daniel. It's me.

1131
01:10:24,953 --> 01:10:26,829
<i>I did something crazy, Hye-jun.</i>

1132
01:10:27,413 --> 01:10:28,414
<i>I can start again.</i>

1133
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:31,292
<i>Look at Hae-hyo now.
You two started out together.</i>

1134
01:10:31,376 --> 01:10:34,671
<i>Since he has support,
things are working out for him.</i>

1135
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:37,298
<i>If I can’t do it on my own, I should quit.</i>

1136
01:10:38,257 --> 01:10:40,259
Now, you can go to the military.

1137
01:10:40,343 --> 01:10:42,387
You said you’re my family.
You want the best for me.

1138
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:44,555
-Family can’t solve everything.
-Then,

1139
01:10:44,639 --> 01:10:46,432
don’t tell me what to do with my life.
