00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,358
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS AN
"EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT" AND IS SUPPORTED

BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, TOURISM
AND THE KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:10,727
The parking lot.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,354
I got held up at the gym.

6
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,357
Did you ask the director
when we're shooting again?

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,235
<i>It's next month.
Don't be such a workaholic.</i>

8
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:20,153
I like working.

9
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,656
I'm going to make up for my lost time.

10
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:26,409
I'll be right up.

11
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,218
Hello?

12
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:45,887
<i>Yes, hello. This is Sergeant Lee Jin-yeong</i>

13
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:48,265
<i>of the Criminal Investigation Division
at Gangnam Police Station.</i>

14
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,642
<i>Is this Mr. Sa Hye-jun?</i>

15
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:52,978
Yes, speaking.

16
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:55,063
<i>I called to ask you to come by the station</i>

17
00:00:55,146 --> 00:00:57,524
<i>to give us a statement</i>

18
00:00:57,607 --> 00:01:00,610
<i>regarding the death of Mr. Charlie Jung.</i>

19
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:28,138
I didn't quite catch you just now.

20
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,058
Which station are you calling from?

21
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:41,401
<i>The police are busy at work
behind the police-line</i>

22
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:44,779
<i>at a residence in Nonhyeon-dong,
Gangnam-gu.</i>

23
00:01:44,863 --> 00:01:48,241
<i>This morning, Jung Jin-su,
Korea's genius fashion designer,</i>

24
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:51,661
<i>who was also known as Charlie Jung,
was found dead in this house.</i>

25
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,122
<i>-Hey.</i>
-Did you see the news about Mr. Jung?

26
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:56,207
Not yet.

27
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:59,002
I'm on my way to the station
to give my statement.

28
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:02,923
He called a few days ago,
but I didn't answer.

29
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,215
Really?

30
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,675
You must be in shock.

31
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,011
<i>I sure was.</i>

32
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,473
I'll be heading to his funeral later.
What about you?

EPISODE 11

35
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:38,375
Ae-suk,

36
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:41,961
-how do I look?
-Pretty.

37
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:44,339
You didn't mean that
even in the slightest.

38
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:45,965
Why don't you get something, too?

39
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:48,051
I don't shop at department stores.

40
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,095
Well, your situation has changed.

41
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:53,932
You're Sa Hye-jun's mom.

42
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:55,225
Sa Hye-jun?

43
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,644
Are you Sa Hye-jun's mother?

44
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,939
-Yes.
-My gosh!

45
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:02,065
Yes, hello.

46
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,734
Let me help you find
something perfect for you.

47
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,529
Well, I'm not here to shop today.

48
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:08,822
That'll be my friend.

49
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:10,824
You made it sound like we're the same age.

50
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:13,451
I'm younger, you see.
We're not real sisters,

51
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:16,246
but her family and mine
are extremely close.

52
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,581
-Can I get you some tea?
-Do you have club soda?

53
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,624
We do.

54
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,631
Are you really not going to buy anything?

55
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:28,633
What would people think

56
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:30,760
once they find out you're Hye-jun's mom?

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,596
Do my clothes look too shabby?

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,183
Of course not,
but don't you want to splurge?

59
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:40,895
Hye-jun earning a lot of money
has nothing to do with me.

60
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,356
How so when you're his mom?

61
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,359
I'm sure he has something
planned for the family.

62
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:48,319
Has he said anything yet?

63
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:55,660
Mom.

64
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,246
Yes, what is it? Can I get you something?

65
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:01,249
How much do we have in debt?

66
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:04,627
<i>Tell him you want to move.</i>

67
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:08,006
I don't even know how much he earns.

68
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:09,466
Move next door to Hae-hyo's.

69
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,426
Hye-jun can afford it now,

70
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:14,137
so let Yeong-nam pay back his own debt.

71
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,889
Hye-jun shouldn't have to.

72
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,977
Exactly, so why should I be interested
in his earnings?

73
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,481
I never want to talk about money with him.

74
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,733
But you've earned that right.

75
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:28,276
Not Yeong-nam though.

76
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:36,493
The director's office, the supply closet,

77
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,912
and a spacious hall are the requirements.

78
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,872
It'll be done in no time.

79
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:44,250
You can't contain your smile, can you?

80
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:47,712
What did I tell you? I said Hye-jun
would make it big this time.

81
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:50,673
I had no idea
it'd be to this extent though.

82
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,884
Your troubles are over now.

83
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,886
He's there for you to rely on.

84
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:58,681
Meanwhile, my son asked me for 100,000 won
when leaving this morning.

85
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,434
Even though he has a job, it's not enough.

86
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:02,602
Guys, it's us.

87
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,270
-Hey, guys.
-Come on in.

88
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:05,188
Have a seat.

89
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:06,940
Come in.

90
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,318
Yeong-nam, congratulations.

91
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:12,028
Will you be moving soon?

92
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,697
Why wouldn't he
when Hye-jun's a superstar now?

93
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,408
You should treat us to dinner today.

94
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:18,451
Can you believe him?

95
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:21,287
He already did a few days ago.

96
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,665
That's then, and this is now.

97
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:27,502
The more you spend,
the more money you'll earn.

98
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:29,045
<i>Clueless brats.</i>

99
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,130
Hye-jun's the one earning the money,
not me.

100
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:34,008
Hasn't he given you
any money to spend yet?

101
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:39,806
How can he not when he earns so much now?

102
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,474
Okay, I'll treat you guys.

103
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,643
Take your pick.
The budget's 5,000 won each.

104
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:46,145
Let's go for a course meal of 50,000 won.

105
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:47,981
-Sounds great.
-All right!

106
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,816
-And beef!
-No, forget it.

107
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,234
No, you're buying.

108
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,321
#BEST ACTOR AWARD #FOREVER #GOODBYE #2019

109
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,744
<i>Stop pretending to be close to Hye-jun.</i>

110
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,122
HYE-JUN NEVER TALKS ABOUT YOU
ARE YOU REALLY CLOSE?

111
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:06,749
"Pretend to be close"?

112
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:14,966
Off to the funeral?

113
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,802
-Yes, Mr. Charlie Jung's.
-I saw it on the news.

114
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:20,805
You didn't walk for him that much though,
did you?

115
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:22,974
He preferred models like Hye-jun.

116
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:25,101
-He must not be going.
-We're going together.

117
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:28,646
What is his manager thinking?

118
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,400
There are comments online
regarding his relationship with Mr. Jung.

119
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:34,193
Going there could lead to a scandal.

120
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,237
They're targeting him
now that he's famous,

121
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,531
so why should he get swayed?
He's not like that.

122
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:43,912
You must be a saint.
How can you not be bothered by this?

123
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,372
He's a friend, but also your competitor.

124
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:49,751
Thinking about your career
keeps me up at night these days.

125
00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:52,378
You should have won Rookie of the Year.

126
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:54,339
I can't even look your dad in the face.

127
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,637
This will keep you up some more.

128
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:03,932
-What do you mean?
-I'll also be in the TV series

129
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:05,350
that he will be in.

130
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,644
-Says who?
-Like always, says me.

131
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,397
You only thought you had a say in it.
It was always me who set the deal.

132
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,191
Do you know what I had to do

133
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:15,151
because you wanted to be in <i>Catch</i>?

134
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,111
You're here to apologize,

135
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:19,072
so what's with the silence?

136
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,700
No matter how hard I think about it,

137
00:07:22,784 --> 00:07:24,494
I can't recall what I said.

138
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:28,456
There were many things,
but this one I still remember.

139
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,670
You said I was exploiting
pure and innocent souls.

140
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:36,464
Are you sure

141
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,467
it's an apology you want though?

142
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:43,471
I did my homework on you,

143
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:45,807
you're not one
to be fazed by such comments.

144
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,977
What I want is friendship.

145
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:53,189
The apology was an excuse
to set up a meeting.

146
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:57,485
Admitting that scored you points.

147
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,115
-What is it that you want from me?
-Your connections, possible investors,

148
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:04,951
and to get on your good side.

149
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:09,122
<i>It's for you
that I gave him the time of day.</i>

150
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,916
I got cast in <i>Catch</i>

151
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,420
because Park Do-ha asked the director.

152
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:16,879
Lee Tae-su had no say in it.

153
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:21,426
Wait. Are you saying he played me?

154
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:26,764
Do you know how many investors
I introduced him to?

155
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:28,391
You should've told me first.

156
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,226
Your takeaway from this

157
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,896
should be the fact that I'm willing to do
the things I hate for your sake.

158
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:37,317
I was the one who stepped in
when the director and the producer

159
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,902
were wondering who to cast
for <i>Normal Person</i>.

160
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,865
And the numbers of followers
on social media you're so proud of?

161
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:49,829
Oops.

162
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:53,958
It seems like I walked in
on a serious conversation.

163
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,419
I'll leave you to it then.

164
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,421
School's on a break. Where are you off to?

165
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:00,298
Study.

166
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,300
What about my followers?

167
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:05,887
Never mind. I don't want to talk about it.

168
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:10,808
-You have a blind date next week.
-What?

169
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:11,976
I won't do it.

170
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,229
I'm on edge these days

171
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:17,440
and your brother is enough of a headache.

172
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:24,113
Everything you have was handed to you
and not obtained.

173
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,616
It's about time you faced reality.

174
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:33,873
Thanks a lot for this.

175
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:37,460
The date was to happen anyway
since you're single.

176
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:41,756
Anyway, just do as Mom says.

177
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,475
CALL HISTORY

178
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,061
I haven't seen him in over a year.

179
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,147
Then…

180
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:01,984
Why do you think he called you recently?

181
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:06,030
Haven't you checked the texts yet?

182
00:10:09,117 --> 00:10:11,035
MIN-JAE

183
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:15,248
May I take this call?

184
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,541
Sure thing.

185
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:22,964
Hey, Min-jae.

186
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:25,258
<i>What's going on?
Weren't you coming right up?</i>

187
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:28,136
I'm at the police station.

188
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:30,388
<i>Mr. Charlie Jung passed away</i>

189
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:31,889
<i>and I'm giving my statement.</i>

190
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:34,267
And you went there alone?

191
00:10:34,892 --> 00:10:37,520
<i>How can you go there
without discussing it with me first?</i>

192
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,856
All I thought about
was getting here quick.

193
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,650
Are you aware
that most of your hate comments online

194
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:44,527
are of you and him?

195
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,778
It's not true though.

196
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:50,158
When will it be over?

197
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:52,952
I just got here.

198
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:55,955
Later, Hae-hyo and I
will go to his funeral--

199
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:57,415
What about our meeting?

200
00:10:57,498 --> 00:10:59,208
<i>Let me finish, will you?</i>

201
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:03,713
The funeral can't take place
until the investigation is wrapped up.

202
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,465
I'll be right over.

203
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,603
GANGNAM POLICE STATION

204
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:23,608
-Where's your car?
-Get in first!

205
00:11:23,691 --> 00:11:24,901
Deal with that later.

206
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:28,112
It's in the back.

207
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,156
She's scaring me.

208
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:20,581
Are you insane?

209
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,877
Why are you so mad at me?

210
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:27,171
Aren't you aware of your current status?

211
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:30,216
Another Hollywood agency contacted me.

212
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:32,802
Director Mark James' agency too.

213
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,762
He says he's visiting
and he wants to meet you.

214
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:38,015
A world-renowned movie director
is coming to Korea to meet you!

215
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:40,059
Is that more important
than someone's death?

216
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,562
A person just passed away.

217
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,440
I shouldn't be calculative.

218
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:48,693
Is that the kind of person
you want me to be?

219
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:50,486
Yes, I do!

220
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:54,615
Don't you realize

221
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,743
that there are people
who want to see you fail?

222
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:03,374
You're fully aware of the rumors
about you and him,

223
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:05,251
so why give them more to chew on?

224
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,211
There are people like that,

225
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:10,298
but there are also people who support me.

226
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:15,636
Min-jae,

227
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:19,223
I believe in the good of this world.

228
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:22,810
It's how I became a star.
Just think of my journey so far.

229
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:24,895
This is a miracle beyond explanation.

230
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:37,033
I understand how you feel
and I'm grateful for the concern,

231
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:43,998
but please be considerate of my wishes
to pay my respects to him.

232
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:48,669
Always the good guy, huh?

233
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:52,798
Meanwhile, your heart is too gentle.

234
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,553
It won't be enough to protect
your new superstar.

235
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,056
-Don't you think so?
-Get away from me.

236
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,851
What if a reporter saw you?

237
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,562
I can't even imagine.

238
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,070
FASHION DESIGNER CHARLIE JUNG
FOUND DEAD AT HIS RESIDENCE

239
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,488
POSSIBLY FROM SUICIDE

240
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,247
Hello, Mr. Lee.

241
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:31,253
Just look at you. You're looking
better than ever these days.

242
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:34,590
What's your secret?

243
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,718
Being in front of the camera
must be treating you well.

244
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:39,637
I'm not a regular yet though.

245
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,639
My seniors won't give up their spots.

246
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:43,099
But you've been on a roll.

247
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,517
I read your new exclusive.

248
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,519
I'm still living
from paycheck to paycheck though.

249
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:50,439
I wish I could afford
to buy a studio apartment of my own.

250
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,692
Won't that happen soon?

251
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,568
You can start a YouTube channel.

252
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:57,363
Our company provides management
for online celebrities too.

253
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:01,575
As if I could be one.

254
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,536
It's a pie in the sky.

255
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:09,041
This is exactly what I love about you.

256
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,710
Your honesty.

257
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,129
It must be why luck finds me.

258
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,381
I saw Sa Hye-jun at the police station.

259
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:16,966
He was asked for a statement.

260
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:19,552
So that's why you wanted to see me.

261
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,846
You know Sa Hye-jun better than anyone.

262
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,099
You were his manager
when he worked as a model, right?

263
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,018
What is it that you want to know?

264
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,440
Were Charlie Jung and him
in a relationship?

265
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:36,360
You sure know what to ask.

266
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,780
How do you want me to answer this?

267
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:41,407
Add some drama, please.

268
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:44,869
I want to be a writer, you see.

269
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:50,249
My plan's been canceled.

270
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,084
I'll come to you instead.

271
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:22,072
Sorry for making you come here.

272
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,867
You're the busier one, so it's only fair.

273
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:26,702
What should we have?

274
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:29,455
-Is this where you teach?
-Yes.

275
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:32,958
We'll eat after I hear you out.

276
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:34,752
What's so important?

277
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:39,507
I'm always grateful toward you, you know.

278
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,426
That I approve.

279
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:45,679
As you know, I opened my own salon,

280
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,098
but I don't have many clients.

281
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,059
Oh, dear.

282
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:51,811
You seem thrilled.

283
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,147
Since you lack clients,
I'm like your savior, right?

284
00:16:56,106 --> 00:16:58,359
It's why I'm cutting you loose.

285
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:01,070
Me? Why?

286
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,240
Sticking to clients
that I'm already close to

287
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,533
might end up ruining me.

288
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:10,955
Men's makeup is too simple and boring.

289
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:12,873
Meanwhile with women,

290
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:15,709
there's more to do
and the change is dramatic.

291
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:19,129
For men, it's more about
the hair than the makeup.

292
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:20,381
Exactly.

293
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:24,218
I know you guys have been hiring me
to help out a friend,

294
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:25,469
but I want to quit.

295
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,972
You want to cut me all together?

296
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:31,308
No, but I'll reduce my service
to only certain events instead of

297
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:32,560
always being on standby.

298
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:34,645
If you guys agree, that is.

299
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:37,857
I'm telling you first though.
Hye-jun doesn't know yet.

300
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:41,735
Well,

301
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,238
I'm glad I was first to know.

302
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:47,366
I also appreciate

303
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:50,744
how you're letting me go
before I have to ask for it.

304
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:52,705
-Thanks.
-How did you know?

305
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,624
You guys have helped me out enough.

306
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,461
I kept working with you
because of my situation,

307
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,755
but this will only make me
dependent on you.

308
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,009
How is that a bad thing?

309
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:06,176
It is.

310
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,681
Over time, you won't be able
to live without the other person.

311
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:14,101
Sounds good to me.

312
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:15,728
Maybe in a horror movie.

313
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,773
<i>Hello.</i>

314
00:18:19,857 --> 00:18:22,234
-Hello.
-Hello.

315
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:29,325
My name is An Jeong-ha, the makeup artist.

316
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,619
I will be your tutor for the day.

317
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,665
Did you take the aptitude test
at the Career Center?

318
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,583
-Yes.
-Yes.

319
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:41,211
Are you here because you have
an aptitude to become a makeup artist?

320
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:42,671
-Yes.
-We did.

321
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,672
I was bored.

322
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,884
I asked you to submit some questions
before our lecture today,

323
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:49,678
and the question I got the most was,

324
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,348
"Why did you want to become
a makeup artist?"

325
00:18:54,475 --> 00:18:56,352
It was when I was in second grade.

326
00:18:56,894 --> 00:18:58,979
When I washed my hair
before going to school,

327
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:01,565
my mom always applied lotion on my face.

328
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:05,486
Her touch felt warm and comforting

329
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,238
when she applied the lotion on my face.

330
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:11,533
So I wanted to share that feeling
with other people.

331
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:19,416
-What's wrong with her?
-What is that?

332
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,965
-How?
-Goodness.

333
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:27,633
-She's pretty.
-She really is.

334
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:32,262
Makeup artists not only
make people beautiful,

335
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:37,309
but they can also heal
the wounded hearts of people.

336
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:44,399
TO PARK SU-YEON
THANK YOU FROM SA HYE-JUN

337
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:48,028
Hello?

338
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:50,322
Yes, sir.

339
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,116
Okay.

340
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:02,543
The vice president is here.
He stopped by to see you.

341
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,795
Why me?

342
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:16,390
This is Mr. Sa Gyeong-jun.

343
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:17,891
He's Sa Hye-jun's brother.

344
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,687
It's nice to meet you. I didn't know
we had such a valuable employee.

345
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:24,982
We're trying to hire your brother
to model for our bank.

346
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,860
I'm sure he has an account with us, right?

347
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:33,490
Of course. Before he got famous,

348
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:36,159
he came by to have a meal
with his brother.

349
00:20:36,243 --> 00:20:38,787
Mr. Sa here also got me
an autograph from him.

350
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,583
Then, he must be a VIP member of our bank.
He's in a lot of ads these days.

351
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,002
How come I never had a meal with him?

352
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:02,561
Did you hear the branch manager?

353
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,731
When will you bring
your brother for a meal?

354
00:21:06,356 --> 00:21:07,941
I never agreed to that.

355
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,568
But you didn't say no, either.

356
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,322
Go inside. I need to use the restroom.

357
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,700
You're the star of our bank.

358
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:17,993
You can do it.

359
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,537
Cheer up!

360
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:23,206
What's wrong with her?

361
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,209
I can't live like this.

362
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:32,799
Hello?

363
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:37,054
Yes. We're making pdf files, too.

364
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:39,348
When we sue, we'll attach yours, too.

365
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:45,979
It's a war on hateful comments.

366
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:49,483
This also proves you're a star now.

367
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,695
Park Do-ha's fans are posting
a lot of hateful comments

368
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,447
because you won the award, not him.

369
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,533
It started after <i>Gateway</i> was over, right?

370
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,202
Yes. It's so odd.

371
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:02,662
I can't figure out the source.

372
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,291
It's negative viral marketing.
I bet they hired an agency for it.

373
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,753
Exactly, my point. Why would someone
hire an agency to mar his reputation?

374
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:11,046
His competition for ads?

375
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,841
I bet all that knowledge
makes you hungry fast.

376
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:16,385
Can I go and eat <i>jjamppong</i>?

377
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,804
You can never have too much <i>jjamppong</i>.

378
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:19,930
Go ahead.

379
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,018
Hye-jun, what's next on your schedule?

380
00:22:25,102 --> 00:22:27,521
Isn't that your job, not mine?

381
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,356
Sorry.

382
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:33,110
You can go home. I can drive myself home.

383
00:22:33,193 --> 00:22:35,237
-Bye, Ms. Lee.
-Bye.

384
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:41,326
Did you check your account?
I sent you your cut.

385
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:43,829
-I did.
-What will you do with it?

386
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:45,288
Are you just going to save it?

387
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:51,169
Don't you think you should
move out of your house now?

388
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:52,712
You don't even have your own room.

389
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:54,381
Move out to Gangnam.

390
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:04,266
<i>Let's have a family meeting.</i>

391
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,602
<i>Let's talk about how we're stressed
because of Hye-jun's popularity.</i>

392
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:08,895
What stress?

393
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,565
<i>I agree.</i>

394
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:14,151
I knew it.

395
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:16,361
You would have to agree with him.

396
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,038
MY FAMILY

397
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:28,498
Let's see.

398
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:32,043
<i>Sure.
I want to know how I'm stressing you out.</i>

399
00:23:32,627 --> 00:23:34,171
Is Hye-jun upset?

400
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:37,132
Are you walking on eggshells
around him now?

401
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:39,092
Success sure changes you.

402
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:40,969
No, I don't do such a thing.

403
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,514
You can't put them there.

404
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:46,183
You have to put them here.

405
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:47,684
Goodness.

406
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,273
-Yeong-nam, why did you carry that?
-Gosh.

407
00:23:53,356 --> 00:23:55,400
-Oh, my.
-Goodness. Are you okay, Yeong-nam?

408
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:57,944
Does he look okay to you?
Let's go to the hospital.

409
00:23:58,028 --> 00:23:59,696
No. I don't need to.

410
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:06,286
You didn't have to come.

411
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,622
To make sure you got treated.

412
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,001
Mr. Sa Yeong-nam.

413
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:31,102
Is it serious?

414
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,564
From the MRI scan, you don't need surgery.

415
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:36,900
-But his pain is severe.
-He never got it treated.

416
00:24:36,983 --> 00:24:38,735
He's never careful.

417
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:40,654
You must be careful.

418
00:24:40,737 --> 00:24:43,114
Or your tendon will get weak
and might rupture.

419
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:44,491
Then, you'll need surgery.

420
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:47,285
I do manual work for a living.

421
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:48,912
There's only so much I can do.

422
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:51,289
If this ruptures,
you wouldn't be able to work.

423
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:54,167
I'll prescribe shots
and physical therapy for now.

424
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:55,919
-We'll observe the progress.
-Okay.

425
00:24:59,506 --> 00:25:00,966
-Bye.
-Bye.

426
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:02,217
Get home safely.

427
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:06,638
Do you need help?

428
00:25:07,222 --> 00:25:08,181
Did you wait for me?

429
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:10,725
Weren't you bored?

430
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,143
This place is pretty fun.

431
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:22,529
Do you want to look around?

432
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,698
That looks fun.

433
00:25:34,124 --> 00:25:35,083
SUPERSTAR SA

434
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,087
<i>I don't think I can meet you today.
I have a family meeting.</i>

435
00:25:40,547 --> 00:25:41,965
<i>I'm going home right away.</i>

436
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,261
I haven't seen Hye-jun in a while.

437
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,054
He's a superstar.

438
00:25:48,138 --> 00:25:50,140
Yes, he is. I'm so happy he's doing well.

439
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,017
But you rarely get to see him.

440
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:56,271
If not seeing each other a lot is
going to break our relationship,

441
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,564
it's better to end it soon.

442
00:25:57,647 --> 00:26:00,317
In that sense, we're doing very well.

443
00:26:01,443 --> 00:26:02,777
Are you guys that steady?

444
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,487
Yes, we are.

445
00:26:06,072 --> 00:26:07,449
I'll go home now.

446
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,993
You say that whenever I'm with you.

447
00:26:10,827 --> 00:26:12,495
I'm anxious these days.

448
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,331
What if my shop goes under?

449
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:15,999
I really don't have any customers.

450
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,710
I need to check on my business approaches.

451
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:20,629
Do you want to meet a female celebrity?

452
00:26:24,341 --> 00:26:25,467
I have two answers.

453
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,469
"Yes, I want to meet her."

454
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,930
"I had too much from Hae-hyo.
Let's not do that."

455
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:33,808
I can't guarantee she'll hire you.

456
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:36,978
She might have
her own makeup artist anyway.

457
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:44,361
-Are you having fun?
-No.

458
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,782
Should we stop, then?

459
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:51,076
No.

460
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,036
-Should we get something to eat?
-Sure.

461
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:56,623
It looks delicious.

462
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:08,093
I lied to my mom.
I told her I would be studying.

463
00:27:10,637 --> 00:27:11,971
That's all right.

464
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,852
She wants me to go on a date.

465
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:21,272
What do you want me to do?

466
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:25,110
Well, I want to tell you
not to go on that date.

467
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:26,569
But then,

468
00:27:27,153 --> 00:27:28,863
I'd have to take responsibility.

469
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:31,199
What responsibility?

470
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,411
Does taking responsibility mean
we have to get married?

471
00:27:37,247 --> 00:27:39,040
No, that's not it.

472
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:44,045
In marriage, responsibility is mutual.

473
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,089
If I try to do that unilaterally,

474
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:47,716
I would be violating your right.

475
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:50,301
You sound smart now.

476
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,096
-What a turnoff.
-What?

477
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:55,223
I turned it on again. I did it.
There it is.

478
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:58,017
I'm not a turnoff anymore.

479
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:01,855
It's all good as long as
we can make each other laugh.

480
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:06,401
-You know, Jin-u.
-Yes?

481
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:09,487
I want to get married.

482
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:17,412
I can't stop thinking about
how it would be like to marry you.

483
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:21,750
It makes me wonder if it would be
a happy ending or end with a breakup.

484
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:25,211
I'm curious about that.

485
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:42,771
<i>I'm going home right away.</i>

486
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,774
Can I stop by for a second?

487
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:52,363
Yes. I can make time.

488
00:28:54,908 --> 00:28:57,243
THE GIVING TREE, HYE-JUN ALL THE WAY

489
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,625
"JJamppong Entertainment sucks."

490
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:04,959
THEY SUCK AT MARKETING, TOO

491
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,504
"I wish he would leave that agency now.

492
00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:08,755
I hate them."

493
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,967
I hate you guys, too.
The feelings are mutual.

494
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,512
What do you mean I suck?

495
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,640
HYE-JUN IS DOING ALL THE WORK

496
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,475
What are you talking about?

497
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,560
I do my money's worth, too.

498
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:29,651
REPORTER KIM SU-MAN

499
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,198
Hello, Ms. Kim.

500
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:38,034
You know, I always cut to the chase.

501
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:42,831
I heard Hye-jun and Charlie Jung
used to date.

502
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:46,459
Who told you that? That's not true at all.

503
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:49,504
You need a lot of money
to survive in that industry.

504
00:29:50,213 --> 00:29:52,215
<i>And I know his family isn't well-off.</i>

505
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,969
If they were involved,
he would've hit it big ages ago.

506
00:29:56,052 --> 00:29:57,762
Why go through all that trouble?

507
00:29:58,388 --> 00:30:00,265
I've known him since he was a model.

508
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:04,978
You're not the only one
who's known him that long.

509
00:30:05,645 --> 00:30:06,688
<i>Okay.</i>

510
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:11,442
What?

511
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,363
That felt shitty.

512
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,116
Today is a shitty day.

513
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:21,786
Who else would've known him that long?

514
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:25,039
Lee Tae-su?

515
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,041
That can't be.

516
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,295
He should know better than anyone.

517
00:30:31,588 --> 00:30:32,964
Gosh, he won't do that.

518
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:34,507
Or he might.

519
00:30:35,341 --> 00:30:38,178
Whatever.
I'll think about it when I have to.

520
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:39,888
And stop reading the comments.

521
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,609
Aren't you a bit too early?

522
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:54,694
You're going to Japan tomorrow
for a fan meet-up event.

523
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:57,906
You told me to have fun here.

524
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,490
You said this place is safe.

525
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:06,039
You know, I am incredibly hurt
and humiliated.

526
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:08,750
I have a wounded heart.

527
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:13,671
The fact that I didn't win
the Best Actor Award

528
00:31:14,297 --> 00:31:15,965
is torturing me.

529
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:19,260
But you won the Popularity Award.

530
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,303
I only won it

531
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:25,225
because my fans voted for me like crazy.

532
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:28,561
Seriously.

533
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,981
I don't want to lose to Sa Hye-jun.

534
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:34,901
<i>It looks like he'll be done for soon.</i>

535
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:37,904
Whose side are you on?

536
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:42,867
I saw you looking at Hye-jun
the other day in the green room.

537
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,120
You seemed to have lingering feelings.

538
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,960
<i>I guess he didn't make it this far
by pure luck.</i>

539
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,045
<i>He's so quick-witted.</i>

540
00:31:54,128 --> 00:31:55,296
What is it?

541
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,882
Now that he's doing well,
do you want to be his agent?

542
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,473
That's my house.

543
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,686
You didn't have to drive
all the way to the alley.

544
00:32:10,353 --> 00:32:11,813
You're so stubborn.

545
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:15,191
Right there. This is fine.

546
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,489
So are you. I wanted
to drop you off at your house.

547
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:24,325
But your stubbornness won today.

548
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,576
Thanks.

549
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,074
What are you doing?

550
00:33:46,616 --> 00:33:48,701
You startled me.

551
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:50,370
What is that?

552
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:53,206
Cleansing foam.
You might get zits if you don't wash up.

553
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:55,416
Do you like me that much?

554
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,086
Do you find my skin precious, too?

555
00:33:59,045 --> 00:34:00,213
No.

556
00:34:01,464 --> 00:34:02,840
I find it very precious.

557
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,511
-You have a family meeting.
-Did you come straight home?

558
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:10,473
-It took longer than it should.
-I did come straight home.

559
00:34:25,321 --> 00:34:26,489
I missed you.

560
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:28,282
Me, too.

561
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,286
Who is that?

562
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:34,705
I'll hate that person.

563
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,291
Gosh, stop it.

564
00:34:44,173 --> 00:34:46,134
<i>-Hey.</i>
-Which unit is yours?

565
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,720
-You left your book. I'll bring it up.
<i>-It's okay. You can give it back later.</i>

566
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:51,722
It'll only take a second.

567
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:53,808
Do you want to come out, then?

568
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,519
<i>I'm sorry. I can't come out right now.</i>

569
00:34:57,937 --> 00:34:58,938
Okay.

570
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:10,074
<i>MAKEUP ARTIST</i>

571
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,936
What's the agenda?

572
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:43,733
My older brother is stressed out
because I'm a famous star now.

573
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,735
I can totally relate.

574
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,863
You too?

575
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,114
I have a lot to say, too.

576
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,827
-Go ahead.
-I can't do it when you ask me.

577
00:35:54,911 --> 00:35:56,454
Why? I can't remember it.

578
00:35:57,497 --> 00:35:59,290
Are you already getting old?

579
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:00,750
Have you been drinking a lot?

580
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:02,543
That's not it.

581
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,129
It's because when we meet,
I'm just happy to see you.

582
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,340
I'll write it down when I'm upset.

583
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:11,010
Were you upset?

584
00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:15,681
<i>Yes, I was. I was very upset.</i>

585
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:17,975
No.

586
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,727
I won't be your makeup artist.

587
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:23,397
Why not? Because you were upset?

588
00:36:25,775 --> 00:36:28,611
I want to do women's makeup more.
I talked to Hae-hyo, too.

589
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:33,115
You put him first when it comes to work.

590
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:36,369
I always welcome your jealousy.

591
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:45,044
I will support all the decisions you make.

592
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,172
Thank you.

593
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,132
You did the same for me, too.

594
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,930
I'm sorry
we can't spend much time together.

595
00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:05,314
I didn't have time, either. I'm busy, too.

596
00:37:05,398 --> 00:37:08,651
As you know, I'm the CEO
of An’s Make-UP Studio.

597
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:12,363
I believe I helped you with that studio.

598
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,291
This can be the makeup room.

599
00:37:26,419 --> 00:37:28,629
And the waiting area should be here.

600
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,301
And the washroom can be over there.

601
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,682
I also need a space
where I can get ready and rest.

602
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:47,106
Over here would work.

603
00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:49,984
How come you have
such a good sense of space?

604
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,195
My dad's a carpenter. All good now, right?

605
00:37:53,988 --> 00:37:56,949
No, I still have to pick a name.
What would be good?

606
00:37:57,033 --> 00:38:00,911
I've thought about this,
but I like “An Jeong-Ha Studio" the best.

607
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:03,414
It's embarrassing to use my name.

608
00:38:03,497 --> 00:38:05,583
But you said you wanted your own brand.

609
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:08,502
There's no name that
can better express you than "An Jeong-ha."

610
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,171
Still, I don't like it.

611
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:35,988
Congratulations on the opening
of An's Make-UP Studio.

612
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:38,783
I'll take good care of this.

613
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,660
And thanks for the fridge.

614
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:43,954
I'm sorry I couldn't help you out more.

615
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:45,706
You were out of town because of the shoot.

616
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,542
You must be tired.
Thank you so much for helping.

617
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,631
Do you like it?

618
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:56,217
No, I love it.

619
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,220
My dad sent me this.

620
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,639
It suits the space.

621
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:04,892
Is this also your dad's painting?

622
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,061
No, it's from Hae-hyo.

623
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,562
He helped me out a lot.

624
00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:11,941
I should buy him a meal
for helping you in my place.

625
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:22,243
Can I walk you
to where you're getting picked up?

626
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,245
-No, you can't.
-Why not?

627
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,414
Because then I'd want
to walk you back here.

628
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:29,500
Bye.

629
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:31,836
I'll text you before bed.

630
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:34,171
You have to. I want to hear
about your family meeting.

631
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:48,978
You should go now.

632
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,605
And don't tell my family.

633
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,317
Why hide it?

634
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:58,320
You've worked hard your entire life
to feed your family.

635
00:39:58,404 --> 00:39:59,780
And you got hurt on the job.

636
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,074
Everyone does it.
Why make a big deal out of it?

637
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:04,452
This is actually good.
You should just retire.

638
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,954
Hye-jun makes good money now.
Why should you work?

639
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,707
I'd rather die than mooch off Hye-jun.

640
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,835
-Yeong-nam.
-You know how much I resented my father.

641
00:40:12,918 --> 00:40:14,628
I don't want to be like him.

642
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:31,437
They won't be grateful
if I buy them food here and there.

643
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:37,735
I should just save up
and give them a big chunk of cash.

644
00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:39,445
Right?

645
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:42,323
-Grandpa.
-What is it?

646
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:47,453
Well…

647
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,541
Tell Hye-jun that we should move.

648
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:55,085
He always listens to you.

649
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:56,879
Move where?

650
00:40:57,546 --> 00:40:58,756
Not too far.

651
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:00,549
Near Hae-hyo's place in Hannam-dong.

652
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:02,676
That neighborhood is very expensive.

653
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,971
-I've already done the math,
-Okay.

654
00:41:06,055 --> 00:41:07,181
and we can do it.

655
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,601
Hey, what?

656
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,436
What are you doing here?

657
00:41:13,312 --> 00:41:16,023
Why do you have to wash up
as soon as you get home?

658
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,025
You're picking on me about that now?

659
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,361
Let's have the meeting.
Grandpa, remember. Okay?

660
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,996
Before the meeting, I want to know
why you're stressed out because of me.

661
00:41:33,582 --> 00:41:35,876
Then I'll start with small things.

662
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,838
I often have to pay
when I'm eating with my co-workers.

663
00:41:38,921 --> 00:41:41,340
They expect me to pay
because I'm your brother.

664
00:41:41,423 --> 00:41:44,844
I get that you make good money now,
but I don't actually benefit from it.

665
00:41:46,262 --> 00:41:47,513
And you, Dad?

666
00:41:47,596 --> 00:41:48,931
I have no complaints.

667
00:41:49,014 --> 00:41:51,725
Come on, Dad. You told me
that your acquaintances

668
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,728
always ask you
if Hye-jun gives you an allowance

669
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,314
and if we're moving anytime soon.

670
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:59,900
People say that to me too,
but why is that stressful?

671
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,361
You've always been classy,
so you're an exception.

672
00:42:02,444 --> 00:42:04,154
And stop working at Hae-hyo's.

673
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,491
You always think
you can tell me what to do.

674
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:10,286
Did I ever tell you to quit your job
at the bank?

675
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:12,371
I just don't want you to work so hard.

676
00:42:12,454 --> 00:42:15,332
Everyone works hard.

677
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:18,168
Anyway, why did you suggest this meeting?

678
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:25,175
Well, the branch manager wants me
to schedule a dinner with Hye-jun.

679
00:42:25,718 --> 00:42:29,471
You told me to suggest we should move
to somewhere near Hae-hyo's place.

680
00:42:37,229 --> 00:42:41,650
Whether Hye-jun buys a house or not
is none of our business.

681
00:42:41,734 --> 00:42:44,111
And why bring that up at a family meeting?

682
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,780
It's his money,
so he'll decide how to spend it.

683
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:50,618
We're a family,
and we're all negatively affected by it.

684
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,870
Enough nonsense. This meeting is over.

685
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:54,538
I'll pay back your debt.

686
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:57,666
The family's debt.

687
00:43:03,756 --> 00:43:05,925
Why would you pay off Mom and Dad's debt?

688
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:08,469
Why would you do something like that?

689
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,804
That's exactly why
our family is in this mess now.

690
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,932
If you have that money, let's just move.

691
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:14,725
Gyeong-jun's right.

692
00:43:14,808 --> 00:43:16,602
If you have money to pay off our debt,

693
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:18,812
just buy a place in Gangnam and move out.

694
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:23,150
As you know, I even supported
Gyeong-jun moving out.

695
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:28,197
I'm really sorry
you never had your own room.

696
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:32,660
There's the basement.
I'll turn that space into my room.

697
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,163
Here's my plan.

698
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:38,749
I'll pay off the debt,

699
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,418
buy this house,

700
00:43:43,212 --> 00:43:44,588
and make my own room.

701
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:46,674
Hey.

702
00:43:47,341 --> 00:43:50,010
That's not a good investment.
When you're investing--

703
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,637
Are you lecturing him?

704
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,182
You were even scammed once.

705
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:57,893
Do you object?

706
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,688
No, I don't.

707
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:04,316
It's a good plan.
You made the right choice.

708
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:09,279
The branch manager would like to have
dinner with you. When is good for you?

709
00:44:14,827 --> 00:44:17,121
Our son offered to pay off our debt.

710
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:19,123
Why do I have mixed feelings about it?

711
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,208
Don't you feel the same way?

712
00:44:22,418 --> 00:44:23,669
Yes, I do.

713
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:27,089
By the way, wasn't Gyeong-jun so mean?

714
00:44:27,172 --> 00:44:28,882
You heard what he said, right?

715
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,468
"Why should you pay off
your parents' debt?"

716
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:33,595
He totally drew the line.

717
00:44:35,514 --> 00:44:38,308
But that's not what he actually thinks.

718
00:44:38,392 --> 00:44:39,893
Gosh, you and Gyeong-jun.

719
00:44:41,687 --> 00:44:44,440
Gosh, I'm sorry. Did that hurt a lot?

720
00:44:44,523 --> 00:44:46,150
I told you to go see a doctor.

721
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:47,359
I did.

722
00:44:47,443 --> 00:44:49,778
-And?
-The doctor said I'm fine.

723
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:53,866
They always say it's fine,
but you're in so much pain.

724
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:56,869
You'll have to build Hye-jun's room.
Can you do it?

725
00:44:56,952 --> 00:44:58,871
I should just die if I can't even do that.

726
00:44:58,954 --> 00:45:01,206
Don't say that as a joke.

727
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,250
Don't you know that words have power?

728
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,377
Why say that at your age?

729
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:07,546
Are you worried that I might drop dead?

730
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,925
Stop being such a crybaby.

731
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,552
Turn off the lights, please.

732
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:21,310
Call Jang-man and come up
with a quote for Hye-jun's room.

733
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:23,687
We should build his room
as soon as we can.

734
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:19,660
<i>The conclusion of the meeting.</i>

735
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,912
<i>I'm getting my own room.</i>

736
00:46:31,046 --> 00:46:32,130
<i>Congratulations.</i>

737
00:46:57,708 --> 00:46:58,709
Do I look okay?

738
00:46:58,793 --> 00:47:00,586
You always look great.

739
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:03,464
I'm nervous about meeting Mark James,
the director.

740
00:47:03,548 --> 00:47:06,551
Just enjoy it.
Your life will only get better from here.

741
00:47:08,803 --> 00:47:11,848
<i>HOT ISSUE TOK TOK</i>

742
00:47:11,931 --> 00:47:14,600
Su-man, who told you about Charlie Jung?

743
00:47:14,684 --> 00:47:16,269
It's so detailed.

744
00:47:17,353 --> 00:47:18,604
I was lucky.

745
00:47:19,146 --> 00:47:22,149
I happened to see Sa Hye-jun
at the police station myself.

746
00:47:22,233 --> 00:47:23,943
So they actually dated?

747
00:47:28,906 --> 00:47:30,283
Out of all of your work,

748
00:47:30,867 --> 00:47:32,660
<i>Island Town</i> is my favorite.

749
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:35,079
So, what do you like about it?

750
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:43,254
I like how you blended the basic questions
of what it means to be a human

751
00:47:43,337 --> 00:47:46,340
and how we shall live in a subject matter
in a way that made it,

752
00:47:46,424 --> 00:47:50,011
so that the subject wasn't too obvious.

753
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,888
Well…

754
00:47:52,597 --> 00:47:55,016
It's clear that my instincts were correct.

755
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:59,103
I've never really cared for movies
that get too caught up in their own theme,

756
00:47:59,186 --> 00:48:00,354
if you know what I mean.

757
00:48:00,438 --> 00:48:04,191
So, when I watched the movie,

758
00:48:04,275 --> 00:48:07,153
I feel like I had received a love letter

759
00:48:07,236 --> 00:48:09,155
that was written just for me.

760
00:48:09,238 --> 00:48:12,742
Look, I think we should work together
on my next project,

761
00:48:12,825 --> 00:48:14,952
right from story development.

762
00:48:15,036 --> 00:48:18,539
I could send you a draft of the synopsis
as soon as it's ready.

763
00:48:18,623 --> 00:48:20,082
Thank you so much.

764
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:21,876
-Yeah
-Thank you for your time

765
00:48:21,959 --> 00:48:23,544
and it was really good meeting you.

766
00:48:23,628 --> 00:48:25,338
I look forward to working with you.

767
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:27,214
It's going to be a great show.

768
00:48:27,298 --> 00:48:30,051
The death of the late designer,
Charlie Jung,

769
00:48:30,134 --> 00:48:34,096
has been concluded as suicide.

770
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,726
But since then, everyone's been talking
about his secret love life.

771
00:48:39,352 --> 00:48:40,353
<i>Ms. Kim?</i>

772
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:45,483
<i>Yes, there are rumors
that he dated a number of male models.</i>

773
00:48:45,566 --> 00:48:49,528
From rookies to top models,
he became obsessed with them

774
00:48:49,612 --> 00:48:53,240
once he set his eyes on them,
according to the rumors.

775
00:48:53,324 --> 00:48:57,495
Right. I heard A, the actor who
recently rose to stardom, is one of them.

776
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,248
He's the most popular actor at the moment.

777
00:49:01,332 --> 00:49:04,752
Apparently, he was very close
to Charlie Jung before he became famous.

778
00:49:05,336 --> 00:49:08,881
<i>He walked the runway
for all of Charlie Jung's collections,</i>

779
00:49:08,965 --> 00:49:10,967
<i>and he was Charlie Jung's favorite.</i>

780
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,677
Anyone can tell that A

781
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,389
-is Sa Hye-jun.
-<i>I really want to know who A is.</i>

782
00:49:16,472 --> 00:49:19,183
<i>Let's move on. The second story is…</i>

783
00:49:20,851 --> 00:49:22,228
My gosh!

784
00:49:22,728 --> 00:49:25,231
-What are these tulips for?
-I just wanted to get them.

785
00:49:25,314 --> 00:49:27,358
Seeing flowers always lifts your spirits.

786
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:30,152
Are you consoling me?

787
00:49:30,903 --> 00:49:32,863
<i>That's right.</i>

788
00:49:32,947 --> 00:49:35,366
<i>You must be stressed out.
I know, of course.</i>

789
00:49:36,534 --> 00:49:39,829
No, it's not that. I bought them
because they looked so pretty.

790
00:49:39,912 --> 00:49:43,374
<i>Honestly,
you can't afford to console me right now.</i>

791
00:49:43,457 --> 00:49:45,793
<i>Who knew the tables would turn so quickly?</i>

792
00:49:46,502 --> 00:49:50,131
I think they were talking about Hye-jun
earlier on a TV show.

793
00:49:50,214 --> 00:49:53,009
It'll be stressful
when people find out that it's him.

794
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:56,470
Stressful things happen all the time.

795
00:49:56,554 --> 00:49:58,264
I'm sure he'll handle it.

796
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,685
You seem totally uninterested
in the entertainment industry.

797
00:50:02,768 --> 00:50:05,896
If this happened to Hae-hyo,
I'd sort it all out for him.

798
00:50:07,815 --> 00:50:11,277
What is it? Maybe I can sort it out too.

799
00:50:12,778 --> 00:50:15,322
Hye-jun apparently likes men.

800
00:50:19,285 --> 00:50:23,039
Why does gender even matter
when you love someone?

801
00:50:24,206 --> 00:50:29,128
My gosh, you're very open-minded.

802
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:32,840
But the thing is, not many people
are as open-minded as you are.

803
00:50:33,674 --> 00:50:35,676
Hye-jun has a girlfriend.

804
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,054
I just said that
because it's complete nonsense.

805
00:50:38,554 --> 00:50:41,432
What's wrong with that show?
Which show was it?

806
00:50:50,775 --> 00:50:52,026
Mr. Sa.

807
00:50:52,109 --> 00:50:53,360
Yes?

808
00:50:53,444 --> 00:50:54,653
Well…

809
00:50:58,657 --> 00:50:59,867
Never mind.

810
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:02,078
Go ahead. It's about Hye-jun, right?

811
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:05,539
You must have heard. My goodness.

812
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,918
But is he really gay?

813
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:10,419
What do you mean?

814
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,881
I thought you knew.
That's what they said on the show.

815
00:51:13,964 --> 00:51:16,634
That's what everyone
is talking about online right now.

816
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:20,012
If he's gay, I don't even know what I am.

817
00:51:20,096 --> 00:51:22,598
You don't even know what you are?

818
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:24,934
-My gosh!
-Ma'am, please!

819
00:51:25,017 --> 00:51:28,229
He's always had girlfriends.
Unlike me, who's never dated.

820
00:51:28,771 --> 00:51:29,980
You've never dated?

821
00:51:31,023 --> 00:51:32,525
I knew it!

822
00:51:33,275 --> 00:51:35,194
I can't even keep my life private here.

823
00:51:35,945 --> 00:51:38,656
I don't want information
about your personal life either.

824
00:51:43,786 --> 00:51:45,663
What's going on?

825
00:51:47,998 --> 00:51:50,668
I just received the interview questions
from Beijing TV.

826
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:52,461
-I'll text you them.
-Okay.

827
00:51:56,298 --> 00:51:58,968
Go through them.
The interview will be in English.

828
00:51:59,051 --> 00:52:00,594
You don't need translations, right?

829
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:04,682
I really envy you.
You're fluent in English and Japanese.

830
00:52:05,266 --> 00:52:08,060
He studied hard to make that happen.

831
00:52:09,311 --> 00:52:12,648
Hold on. Why have the reporters
been calling so much?

832
00:52:12,731 --> 00:52:14,150
Did something happen?

833
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:16,152
I have many missed calls too.

834
00:52:19,738 --> 00:52:21,031
Yes, Reporter Choi.

835
00:52:21,574 --> 00:52:22,491
Hey, Jin-u.

836
00:52:23,242 --> 00:52:25,536
Really? I didn't watch that show.

837
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:26,787
What did they say?

838
00:52:26,871 --> 00:52:29,456
A YouTuber is talking about me?
What about it?

839
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,042
No. It's not true.
You can't write articles on that.

840
00:52:32,626 --> 00:52:34,420
Why is that rumor going around?

841
00:52:34,503 --> 00:52:35,504
When?

842
00:52:36,046 --> 00:52:37,006
In the evening?

843
00:52:37,506 --> 00:52:39,383
Okay, I'll look into it.

844
00:52:40,593 --> 00:52:41,802
Okay, I'll watch it.

845
00:52:49,435 --> 00:52:52,980
CHARLIE JUNG'S SUICIDE
IS SA HYE-JUN TO BLAME?

846
00:52:53,898 --> 00:52:56,817
-Min-jae.
-Yes, I heard what's going on.

847
00:52:56,901 --> 00:52:59,528
Calm yourself and move on
to your next schedule.

848
00:53:00,362 --> 00:53:02,781
I'll think about
how we should handle this situation.

849
00:53:04,241 --> 00:53:05,326
Look.

850
00:53:08,162 --> 00:53:10,664
CHARLIE JUNG'S SUICIDE
IS SA HYE-JUN TO BLAME?

851
00:53:10,748 --> 00:53:12,249
<i>All right, a little more.</i>

852
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:14,501
<i>Just a little more. Yes, 100,000!</i>

853
00:53:14,585 --> 00:53:17,296
<i>Over 100,000 people
are watching this live broadcast.</i>

854
00:53:17,379 --> 00:53:18,339
LIVE CHAT

855
00:53:18,422 --> 00:53:21,967
Guys, I'm sure you all know
that Charlie Jung was gay.

856
00:53:22,635 --> 00:53:26,013
He worked as a fashion designer
for a number of decades.

857
00:53:26,096 --> 00:53:28,557
How many models did he work with
over those years?

858
00:53:28,641 --> 00:53:30,893
And Sa Hye-jun is one of them.

859
00:53:30,976 --> 00:53:34,188
I bet he bent over backward
to win Sa Hye-jun's heart.

860
00:53:34,271 --> 00:53:36,732
YOU'LL GET ARRESTED IF THIS IS NOT TRUE

861
00:53:36,815 --> 00:53:39,777
Why would I get arrested?
I never said they dated.

862
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,948
Come on. We can all speculate that much
based on the circumstances.

863
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:46,742
There were never any rumors about him
dating anyone.

864
00:53:46,825 --> 00:53:49,995
But Sa Hye-jun is so handsome.
Isn't it odd?

865
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,747
<i>Unless he likes men.</i>

866
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:53,165
What a lunatic!

867
00:53:53,999 --> 00:53:55,918
Hey, what is wrong with this world?

868
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:58,504
I can't believe
people are spreading this false rumor.

869
00:54:00,297 --> 00:54:01,465
<i>We should sue him.</i>

870
00:54:07,388 --> 00:54:10,015
"Sa Hye-jun was infamous for this
even when he was a model.

871
00:54:10,099 --> 00:54:11,809
I bet he sponsored Sa Hye-jun."

872
00:54:11,892 --> 00:54:14,019
Stop it. Why are you reading it out loud?

873
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:15,896
We need to know what we're dealing with.

874
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,940
I can't stand it. This is disgusting.

875
00:54:18,023 --> 00:54:19,984
Is something wrong with Hye-jun?

876
00:54:20,067 --> 00:54:21,235
You don't need to know.

877
00:54:21,318 --> 00:54:23,988
What's going on? Show me.

878
00:54:24,071 --> 00:54:27,408
It's better not to know.
It'll only upset you.

879
00:54:27,491 --> 00:54:29,410
Gyeong-jun, what do you suggest we do?

880
00:54:29,493 --> 00:54:30,995
You're the brain of the family.

881
00:54:33,122 --> 00:54:35,040
Hye-jun needs a new agency.

882
00:54:35,124 --> 00:54:37,876
A big agency would do a great job
of protecting him.

883
00:54:38,669 --> 00:54:40,421
But I like Ms. Lee.

884
00:54:40,504 --> 00:54:41,714
She seemed very nice.

885
00:54:41,797 --> 00:54:45,134
There's nothing worse
than being incompetent and nice.

886
00:54:47,803 --> 00:54:48,929
Hye-jun.

887
00:54:51,056 --> 00:54:53,726
-Why is everyone still up?
-We were worried.

888
00:54:54,393 --> 00:54:57,062
Can't your agency sue all those people?

889
00:54:58,355 --> 00:54:59,565
You all saw that?

890
00:54:59,648 --> 00:55:02,985
Yes, we did.
How could they say something so crazy?

891
00:55:03,068 --> 00:55:05,404
I can't believe
they're spreading rumors like that.

892
00:55:07,489 --> 00:55:09,908
Don't worry. We're working on it.

893
00:55:11,368 --> 00:55:12,369
I want to rest.

894
00:55:12,453 --> 00:55:13,954
All right, get some rest.

895
00:55:18,709 --> 00:55:21,503
We were excited about him
becoming famous. What is this now?

896
00:55:23,047 --> 00:55:24,214
Dad.

897
00:55:26,759 --> 00:55:30,262
There's no way something actually happened
between them, right?

898
00:55:31,597 --> 00:55:32,806
Do you want a beating?

899
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,561
Dad, you seem to be
growing cold toward me these days.

900
00:55:37,644 --> 00:55:38,687
I'm hurt.

901
00:55:48,155 --> 00:55:51,992
<i>The death of the late designer,
Charlie Jung,</i>

902
00:55:52,076 --> 00:55:53,911
<i>has been concluded as suicide.</i>

903
00:55:53,994 --> 00:55:58,624
<i>However, many people still have questions
about his sudden death.</i>

904
00:56:02,961 --> 00:56:04,755
What will happen to Hye-jun now?

905
00:56:06,256 --> 00:56:08,258
It's not true,
so it'll get all sorted out.

906
00:56:12,304 --> 00:56:14,181
You're here, too.

907
00:56:14,264 --> 00:56:16,475
I wanted to know
what was going on with Hye-jun.

908
00:56:16,558 --> 00:56:18,602
I can't sleep these days.

909
00:56:19,186 --> 00:56:21,438
Is that why you're giving me a hard time?

910
00:56:22,272 --> 00:56:24,316
Whose fault is it
that I can't fall asleep?

911
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,736
Do you have to be
in that drama with Hye-jun?

912
00:56:28,445 --> 00:56:30,572
You guys are shooting the same drama?

913
00:56:30,656 --> 00:56:33,033
Good! You can ride his coattails.

914
00:56:33,117 --> 00:56:34,451
Gosh, you brat.

915
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:36,954
Are you happy that your brother
has to ride coattails?

916
00:56:39,748 --> 00:56:41,333
I need to use the bathroom.

917
00:56:44,545 --> 00:56:47,423
Mom, can't you just trust me?

918
00:56:50,259 --> 00:56:52,177
JIN-U

919
00:56:55,305 --> 00:56:57,891
Why is Jin-u calling Hae-na
at this late hour?

920
00:56:58,517 --> 00:57:00,185
Maybe he needs something.

921
00:57:01,645 --> 00:57:02,604
Answer it.

922
00:57:08,527 --> 00:57:10,654
<i>What took you so long?</i>

923
00:57:10,738 --> 00:57:13,574
<i>You said you were curious
what it'd be like if we got married.</i>

924
00:57:18,996 --> 00:57:21,331
<i>Why are you all quiet? Are you mad at me?</i>

925
00:57:28,172 --> 00:57:29,339
Mom!

926
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:36,180
Stop.

927
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,315
Let's talk tomorrow.

928
00:57:46,899 --> 00:57:48,859
What did you hear?

929
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,950
I will never

930
00:57:57,701 --> 00:58:00,370
put my hands on my children.

931
00:58:12,382 --> 00:58:14,051
Hae-hyo.

932
00:58:18,096 --> 00:58:21,099
Jin-u, this bastard. I'll kill him!

933
00:58:22,351 --> 00:58:24,978
Reporter Yoon,
I'll stop by your office tomorrow.

934
00:58:27,606 --> 00:58:30,609
Right, I'll explain everything.

935
00:58:35,864 --> 00:58:38,951
Write it after hearing what I have to say.
It'll be exclusive.

936
00:58:41,203 --> 00:58:42,204
Yes.

937
00:58:43,705 --> 00:58:44,790
Okay.

938
00:59:02,933 --> 00:59:04,601
LEE TAE-SU

939
00:59:06,436 --> 00:59:07,813
What does he want now?

940
00:59:13,485 --> 00:59:14,528
Hello?

941
00:59:15,571 --> 00:59:16,613
<i>You must be stressed.</i>

942
00:59:17,781 --> 00:59:21,577
I'll tell you how you can sort it out
as an experienced manager.

943
00:59:25,455 --> 00:59:26,957
When can we meet?

944
00:59:32,713 --> 00:59:34,089
Ms. Lee.

945
00:59:35,674 --> 00:59:37,259
You should never

946
00:59:38,093 --> 00:59:41,013
bite off more than you can chew.

947
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,181
Hye-jun is

948
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:47,185
too much of a star for you to embrace.

949
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,396
That sounds so wrong.

950
00:59:49,479 --> 00:59:51,440
Why should I embrace him? He's not a kid.

951
00:59:51,523 --> 00:59:54,026
That was a figure of speech.
You don't get it?

952
00:59:54,109 --> 00:59:56,403
I don't. Just get straight to the point.

953
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:01,867
About Hye-jun and Charlie Jung…

954
01:00:02,784 --> 01:00:06,455
Did you put a weird spin on it
when you were talking to Reporter Kim?

955
01:00:07,331 --> 01:00:08,332
Reporter Kim?

956
01:00:08,874 --> 01:00:11,543
I don't even know her that well.

957
01:00:12,961 --> 01:00:14,713
But she said she knows you very well.

958
01:00:14,796 --> 01:00:17,382
That's not what's important right now.

959
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,512
You can't sort this out for Hye-jun.

960
01:00:22,596 --> 01:00:25,641
And the more famous he becomes,
the bigger the problems will be.

961
01:00:26,308 --> 01:00:27,768
Why don't you

962
01:00:30,437 --> 01:00:32,064
just let him sign with me?

963
01:00:32,898 --> 01:00:33,941
Close your mouth.

964
01:00:36,193 --> 01:00:38,987
What did I even expect from you?
I should've known better.

965
01:00:39,071 --> 01:00:40,697
He's dating a makeup artist, right?

966
01:00:44,368 --> 01:00:46,286
Think about it. I'll give you a pointer.

967
01:00:47,287 --> 01:00:48,830
You can go public with that.

968
01:00:49,748 --> 01:00:52,000
Then people won't think he's gay.

969
01:00:52,584 --> 01:00:54,252
-After that--
-Enough.

970
01:00:54,836 --> 01:00:56,254
I won't let you have your way.

971
01:00:56,338 --> 01:01:00,258
The moment YouTubers mention celebrities,
their view counts soar.

972
01:01:00,342 --> 01:01:02,177
Higher view counts mean more money.

973
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:06,223
They won't even care even if you sue them.

974
01:01:06,306 --> 01:01:09,434
They'll make more money
while they let the lawsuit drag on.

975
01:01:09,518 --> 01:01:12,646
Using someone else's name

976
01:01:12,729 --> 01:01:15,774
is the easiest way to make money.

977
01:01:15,857 --> 01:01:20,112
And the names of celebrities
are always up for grabs to the public.

978
01:01:21,446 --> 01:01:23,365
This is only the beginning for Hye-jun.

979
01:01:24,866 --> 01:01:26,034
Think wisely.

980
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:51,393
I'll stay behind after everyone leaves
and finish up.

981
01:01:51,476 --> 01:01:52,853
You don't have to do that.

982
01:01:52,936 --> 01:01:55,480
Hye-jun paid me a lot for the job.

983
01:01:55,564 --> 01:01:56,773
Goodness.

984
01:01:57,899 --> 01:01:59,776
I want him to have his own room soon.

985
01:02:01,319 --> 01:02:02,988
What is it? Just say it.

986
01:02:05,407 --> 01:02:07,743
Hye-jun has a girlfriend.

987
01:02:07,826 --> 01:02:09,453
Tell him to go public with it.

988
01:02:09,536 --> 01:02:12,039
That way, people will stop
talking such nonsense.

989
01:02:13,123 --> 01:02:16,168
I can't drag someone's daughter into this
for my son's sake.

990
01:02:18,003 --> 01:02:19,129
Goodness.

991
01:02:29,973 --> 01:02:31,266
Take a look.

992
01:02:34,352 --> 01:02:35,687
I like it.

993
01:02:36,396 --> 01:02:37,522
Thanks.

994
01:02:40,776 --> 01:02:42,861
What's Hye-jun up to now?

995
01:02:42,944 --> 01:02:45,739
He's on his schedule.

996
01:02:46,531 --> 01:02:47,741
Didn't you talk to him?

997
01:02:49,993 --> 01:02:52,204
I just didn't know what to say.

998
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,956
The Giving Tree will sue them.

999
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,168
I'll sue all those malicious comments too.

1000
01:03:03,632 --> 01:03:07,719
Do you think things will quiet down
if people find out that Hye-jun

1001
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:09,888
has a girlfriend?

1002
01:03:13,016 --> 01:03:16,770
Min-jae, I'll do anything

1003
01:03:16,853 --> 01:03:18,438
to help Hye-jun.

1004
01:03:18,522 --> 01:03:19,397
<i>No way.</i>

1005
01:03:19,481 --> 01:03:20,982
I said the same thing,

1006
01:03:21,066 --> 01:03:23,110
-but Jeong-ha--
-There must be a way.

1007
01:03:24,236 --> 01:03:26,196
I want to protect Jeong-ha's privacy.

1008
01:03:26,696 --> 01:03:28,323
It'll make her life very difficult
the moment we do this.

1009
01:03:28,406 --> 01:03:30,367
I know. I told her that.

1010
01:03:33,662 --> 01:03:34,996
We won't do it.

1011
01:03:38,416 --> 01:03:40,001
Where are you meeting Hae-hyo?

1012
01:03:41,086 --> 01:03:42,087
He'll be here shortly.

1013
01:03:51,263 --> 01:03:52,347
Hello.

1014
01:03:53,598 --> 01:03:55,392
Reporter Kim Su-man, right?

1015
01:03:57,269 --> 01:03:59,729
Yes. Are you Jung Ji-a?

1016
01:03:59,813 --> 01:04:03,608
Yes. I'm Jung Ji-a,
Sa Hye-jun's ex-girlfriend.

1017
01:04:06,194 --> 01:04:08,196
Hae-hyo told me about you.

1018
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,823
Hi.

1019
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:13,118
-Hi, Min-jae.
-Hey, you're not busy today?

1020
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:17,038
No. I'm free these days,
so I'm taking Pilates lessons.

1021
01:04:29,843 --> 01:04:33,180
It sounds grand since I titled
the broadcast, "confession."

1022
01:04:33,263 --> 01:04:34,389
But it's not really.

1023
01:04:34,472 --> 01:04:36,516
IS IT ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND?
I'M CURIOUS

1024
01:04:38,518 --> 01:04:40,353
Is it about my boyfriend?

1025
01:04:42,439 --> 01:04:43,440
Yes, it is.

1026
01:04:44,649 --> 01:04:47,360
JI-A

1027
01:04:54,743 --> 01:04:56,494
-Hey.
-I met with a reporter today.

1028
01:04:56,578 --> 01:04:58,079
You'll see an article about it.

1029
01:04:58,163 --> 01:04:59,456
What do you mean?

1030
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:01,583
Ji-a came to see me.

1031
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:38,265
Subtitle translation by: Liya Choi

1032
01:06:03,131 --> 01:06:06,068
RECORD OF YOUTH

1033
01:06:06,147 --> 01:06:08,775
<i>What if Jeong-ha sees the interview?</i>

1034
01:06:08,858 --> 01:06:10,902
Well, hello, lover boy.

1035
01:06:10,986 --> 01:06:11,987
I want him even more.

1036
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:14,990
<i>Why did you make me worry all by myself?</i>

1037
01:06:15,073 --> 01:06:17,951
<i>The fact that the people I love
have seen those comments</i>

1038
01:06:18,034 --> 01:06:19,160
hurts my self-esteem.

1039
01:06:19,244 --> 01:06:21,079
<i>He needs a bigger, better agency.</i>

1040
01:06:21,162 --> 01:06:24,457
When does Hye-jun's contract
with the agency mature?

1041
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:26,293
<i>She's going to expose your relationship.</i>

1042
01:06:26,376 --> 01:06:28,169
His image will take a huge blow.

1043
01:06:28,253 --> 01:06:30,171
