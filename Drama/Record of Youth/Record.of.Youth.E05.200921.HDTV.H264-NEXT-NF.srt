RECORD OF YOUTH

2
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,358
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS AN
"EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT" AND IS SUPPORTED

3
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:09,045
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, TOURISM
AND THE KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

4
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,499
Get in.

5
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:55,026
-Do you want to drink this?
-No. I'm a bit nervous.

6
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:58,321
Why are you nervous?
I'm the one who will be rehearsing.

7
00:00:59,614 --> 00:01:01,699
I'm getting close to my dream too early.

8
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:05,328
My goal is having my own brand
under my name.

9
00:01:06,204 --> 00:01:07,914
What a grand goal.

10
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:10,083
That way, I'll get somewhere close.

11
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:14,087
But what does it have to do
with you being nervous?

12
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:17,256
We're all nameless makeup artists
when we start.

13
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,634
We must rely on doing celebrities' makeup.

14
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:20,927
I'm not a celebrity.

15
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:24,180
Well, I wouldn't say you're perfect,

16
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:26,724
but you're better than me.

17
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:31,521
Thank you for this opportunity.

18
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:39,904
Then, do a good job.

19
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:55,503
It's been bothering me the whole time.
I'll be good.

20
00:01:59,382 --> 00:02:00,758
You ought to.

21
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:03,094
Come to think of it,
there's one more thing.

22
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:04,345
You're Hye-jun's fan.

23
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:06,764
To keep your secret, I--

24
00:02:06,848 --> 00:02:09,600
There's no need now.
We already talked about it.

25
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,980
-"We"?
-Yes. Hye-jun and I.

26
00:02:14,564 --> 00:02:16,858
So there's only one thing
I should be grateful for.

27
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:19,360
You're sharp.

28
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:20,903
That way, I won't owe people.

29
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:23,573
Feeling indebted is the worst.

30
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:32,123
Can I drink that?

31
00:02:32,206 --> 00:02:33,499
Of course, you can.

32
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:46,387
If you stayed with me,

33
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,931
I would've taken you with me
to A June Entertainment.

34
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:55,396
I bought a building.

35
00:03:03,696 --> 00:03:05,907
Won't you congratulate me?

36
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:09,202
Congratulations.

37
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,537
Could you please move?

38
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:15,208
All right. Keep acting snobby like that

39
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:18,544
when you have the chance.

40
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:26,427
You're ancient history to me.

41
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:29,722
I have enough power to destroy you
in this industry.

42
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:31,474
I don't care.

43
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:40,691
Did you eat?

44
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:43,319
-I ate a lot. I'm so full.
-It's Hye-jun.

45
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:46,447
-When did you get here?
-About 20 minutes ago.

46
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:48,199
Did you come with Min-jae?

47
00:03:48,282 --> 00:03:50,535
Yes. Are you here for the read-through?

48
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:53,204
I must understand his character
to do the makeup well.

49
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,666
You have to attend
the read-through to know it?

50
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:57,708
Yes, I have to.

51
00:03:59,877 --> 00:04:01,838
-Am I invisible to you?
-No, you're not.

52
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:03,464
You're so nice to her.

53
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:05,049
When were you ever nice to me?

54
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,592
Jealous much? Are you dating?

55
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:07,885
-Are you crazy?
-Are you crazy?

56
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:08,803
-Jinx.
-Jinx.

57
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:10,680
-Buttercup.
-Okay.

58
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:11,973
Jinx, no buttercups.

59
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:13,724
-You're so childish.
-I'm talking.

60
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:15,685
-Hey. On the count of three.
-I'll let go.

61
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:16,894
-In 1, 2, 3.
-In 1, 2, 3.

62
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,771
Gosh. You guys are so childish.

RECORD OF YOUTH

64
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:28,865
EPISODE 5

65
00:04:35,997 --> 00:04:37,248
The closet…

66
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:42,086
The room doesn't feel stuffy.

67
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:47,008
It's hard to find a cheap studio
like this one in Yeouido.

68
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:49,552
Paying 450,000 won
with a 5-million deposit is a steal.

69
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:50,928
There's a maintenance fee.

70
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:53,055
Is there floor heating?

71
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:56,100
You get what you pay for.

72
00:04:57,643 --> 00:05:00,021
The previous studio's rent was
900,000 won, right?

73
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:01,063
Yes.

74
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:03,024
I see. 900,000 won.

75
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:06,569
I want some coffee, too.

76
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:08,654
Nice outfit.

77
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:11,949
You always dress up
when you go to his house.

78
00:05:12,783 --> 00:05:14,619
No. I always dress up.

79
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,040
Are you happy wearing hand-me-downs?

80
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,043
I can't afford to buy
such expensive clothes.

81
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:24,128
I'm happy to get them for free.

82
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,923
Why would you be sensitive over clothes?

83
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,009
People with a lot of siblings
grew wearing hand-me-downs.

84
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:32,053
But she's not related to you.

85
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:35,097
Sometimes, a mere stranger
might be better than my own sibling.

86
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:37,183
Look at your brother.

87
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,685
You paid for his school and wedding,
but he never calls.

88
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:42,647
I'm happy as long as he's happy.
I don't want anything from him.

89
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:45,983
You should be generous
toward your father, too.

90
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,277
I can't find my generosity
when it's about him.

91
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,952
They are talking about me.

92
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:00,957
Gosh. I can hear everything
through the walls in this house.

93
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:02,875
I don't want to hear it.

94
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:04,669
I'm back.

95
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:09,048
You should drink black coffee.

96
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:10,216
No, it's bitter.

97
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:13,177
Black coffee is better for your health.

98
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,222
I even got us a coffee maker.
Why do you do that?

99
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:19,183
Instant coffee is the best.
Why do you always stop me?

100
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:22,144
Being stressed over coffee
will be worse for his health.

101
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,771
You're the best, my son.

102
00:06:24,313 --> 00:06:26,774
It's Saturday.
Where did you go early in the morning?

103
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:27,858
Well,

104
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:29,860
I went to see some studios.

105
00:06:29,944 --> 00:06:31,487
-Do you want coffee?
-No.

106
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,447
-What studio?
-Are you going somewhere?

107
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:36,075
To work at Hae-hyo's house.

108
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:38,786
You should quit that job.
I'll give you an allowance.

109
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:41,956
You don't make much.
How will you manage that?

110
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:44,041
I have a nice job now.

111
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,252
I don't want you to work for her.

112
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:47,461
If you think about it,

113
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:49,547
we all work for someone.

114
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,465
"Is that someone a company or a woman?

115
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:54,635
Is the company big or small?
Do they offer good benefits or not?"

116
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,304
Those are the only differences.

117
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:58,889
What about Hye-jun?
If I were him, I would hate it.

118
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:00,933
But that doesn't seem to bother him.

119
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:04,061
-Since he has high self-esteem.
-No, more like he's got no pride.

120
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:08,482
I'm different. Look how I want
to take care of you now that I have a job.

121
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:09,650
If you want to,

122
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:11,569
save the money for your wedding.

123
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:13,195
I need a girlfriend first.

124
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,032
I'm moving to a studio near my office.

125
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,367
Dad, I don't want it.

126
00:07:18,993 --> 00:07:21,495
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

127
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,290
-What?
-Coffee isn't what's important right now.

128
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:27,043
Dad, it's okay.
I can't keep this from her.

129
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:31,255
I told you to tell her when you move out.
You'll just end up fighting now.

130
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:32,631
So you already knew?

131
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:34,091
Dad approved of it.

132
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:37,887
Yeouido is close,
but the transportation isn't convenient.

133
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,722
He has to make two transfers.

134
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:42,558
Making two transfers in Seoul
isn't a big deal.

135
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:44,769
How much is the rent?

136
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,521
It's 900,000 won a month.

137
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:50,274
Did you say "900,000 won"?
900,000 won a month?

138
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,486
You make 3,5 million won a month.
How much can you save

139
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:56,364
after the rent, maintenance fee,
and living expenses?

140
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,075
What about your future?

141
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:00,451
I want to be happy now.

142
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:02,995
I might die in a car accident tomorrow.

143
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,288
How dare you say that?

144
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:06,582
It hurt. I'm just saying.

145
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,168
Honey, he's just like your father!

146
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:11,087
-Gosh.
-He's just like me.

147
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:16,634
Yes. He does take after me.

148
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:20,971
I don't want him to take after me
in that way.

149
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,432
He's nothing like my father!

150
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:26,811
How much money did you save up?

151
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:29,605
How can I? I just started working.

152
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:32,233
You had a part-time job in college.
Did you spend it all?

153
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:33,859
We paid for your tuition.

154
00:08:33,943 --> 00:08:35,694
We're his parents. That's our duty.

155
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:37,071
Don't brag about it.

156
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:41,867
Come to think of it, he's always been
this way ever since he was young.

157
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:45,413
Hye-jun only spends the money he has.

158
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:47,373
But he doesn't.

159
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:49,291
He spends way more than he earns.

160
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,876
He's an impulsive buyer, too.

161
00:08:51,502 --> 00:08:53,254
-Is he?
-Come on, Dad.

162
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:56,215
Which one of our family members
is proud and pretentious?

163
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:59,385
He wants to live comfortably on his own
without any stress.

164
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:00,886
That's what Father did.

165
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,389
When he was young,
he neglected his family.

166
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:05,975
Why do you keep saying
I take after him? Dad!

167
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:07,810
No! Never.

168
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:10,104
Mom, I'm an adult now.

169
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:14,024
I don't need your permission.
I'm just trying to leave on a good note.

170
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:15,317
Let's have a family meeting.

171
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:18,612
Why bring in the family?
I'm moving out with my own money.

172
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:19,947
Then, just move out.

173
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:22,741
-Where are you going?
-I have to go to work.

174
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:26,454
I never expected anything
from my children.

175
00:09:26,537 --> 00:09:29,790
Now that you have a proper job,
I thought you're all set.

176
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,542
But look at what you're doing.

177
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,253
I might have to clean up
after you until I die.

178
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:35,254
Mom.

179
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:37,089
Mom.

180
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:40,342
Gosh, what's wrong with her?

181
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,386
Dad, you weren't helping at all.

182
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,597
No, I was helping you.

183
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,142
But you said she'd be happy
if you told her to quit her job.

184
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:50,227
She's not happy.

185
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:53,397
-Something is up.
-Like what?

186
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,034
<i>GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING</i>

187
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:07,119
You're reading that book a lot.

188
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,413
It's always a nice read.

189
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,711
"<i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i>."

190
00:10:17,254 --> 00:10:18,714
What is this book about?

191
00:10:18,797 --> 00:10:19,924
An emotional affair.

192
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:22,718
A girl whose family went bankrupt

193
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:24,595
works for a rich family as a maid.

194
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:33,187
<i>At the house, the head of the family…</i>

195
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:40,861
You punk. I have been
too nice to you, haven't I?

196
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:42,029
Why are you mad at me?

197
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:43,322
You're talking nonsense.

198
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:46,075
Yes, but there's a reasonable doubt.

199
00:10:46,158 --> 00:10:49,870
Mom's behavior is so odd
that it makes me suspect her.

200
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:51,455
What's odd about that?

201
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:53,832
It's been 10 years.
Of course, she's attached.

202
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,834
Exactly. Why work there for a decade?

203
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:57,336
Isn't that odd to you?

204
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:00,464
She even quit once because it was hard.
But she went back.

205
00:11:01,048 --> 00:11:03,926
I'm sure there's a reason
behind her working there.

206
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:08,389
You punk.

207
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:31,996
<i>My job brings me deeply
into someone else's private life.</i>

208
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:36,250
<i>I find out things that I wish I didn't.</i>

209
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,712
REGISTRY OF ACCEPTED STUDENTS
WON HAE-NA

210
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:42,256
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ACCEPTANCE
TO SEOHAN LAW SCHOOL

211
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:44,216
-Hae-na.
-What?

212
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,843
You got in.

213
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:47,594
I know.

214
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:50,431
-Where are you going?
-Out.

215
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:52,016
Who are you hanging out with?

216
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:54,643
You know all of my friends.

217
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:56,645
Hae-na.

218
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,774
You got into law school
which is a happy occasion.

219
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:02,609
Shouldn't we celebrate it together?

220
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:04,445
We must celebrate it as a family.

221
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:06,196
I will. Set up a date.

222
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,448
Am I your secretary?

223
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:09,199
You're the one who wants to.

224
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:12,286
Forget it.
Take your first step without our blessing.

225
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,123
-You're home, Hae-na.
-Ms. Han.

226
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,584
I got into law school.

227
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,627
Gosh, congratulations.

228
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:22,796
But I knew you would get in.

229
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,381
Nonetheless, congratulations.

230
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:28,719
What do I need to do to set it up
without making you my secretary?

231
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:31,805
Why the change of heart?

232
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:34,475
I want my parents' blessing
when I take my first step.

233
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,560
You take after me.

234
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:39,104
You're not too proud
and are always practical.

235
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:40,147
Which restaurant?

236
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,857
I'll book it.

237
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,859
When you're obedient like this,

238
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:46,111
I make sure to reward you for it.

239
00:12:47,738 --> 00:12:50,949
You're so simple.
Well, that's what I like about you, Mom.

240
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:53,202
-See you later.
-Okay.

241
00:12:57,873 --> 00:13:00,000
Did she just one-up me?

242
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:02,920
You can't keep a tally with your children.

243
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:05,339
You let them win
even if you know their agenda.

244
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:07,966
<i>She's lecturing again.
She's having a field day.</i>

245
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:10,594
You want coffee first, right?

246
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:13,180
I'll drink it later. I had coffee at home.

247
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:33,826
<i>I didn't like this job
when I first started.</i>

248
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:39,581
<i>While working,
I became aware that we are all equal.</i>

249
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:43,961
<i>I didn't learn it. I became aware of it.</i>

250
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:53,262
<i>Placing the object exactly where it was</i>

251
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:56,849
<i>as if no one touched it after moving it</i>

252
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,935
<i>is the most important rule of cleaning.</i>

253
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:11,864
-Do you want coffee?
-Yes. I'll drink it now.

254
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:17,077
Cleaning the entire house twice a month
puts me at ease.

255
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,832
-It's not because I don't trust you.
-I know. That's the thing with cleaning.

256
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:24,460
Even we bring in a lot of dust
into the house.

257
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:28,297
Why don't you hire more housekeepers?

258
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,339
I don't…

259
00:14:29,423 --> 00:14:33,135
<i>If I tell her I don't like
other housekeepers, she'd be too proud.</i>

260
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:36,764
Given the stress I'd get
from bringing strangers into my home,

261
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:38,182
I'd rather clean it myself.

262
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:40,517
Here.

263
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:41,977
That's how it is at first.

264
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,979
Once you get past it, it won't bother you.

265
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:47,107
<i>I can't seem to get past that.</i>

266
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:48,275
Sit down and drink.

267
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:52,821
No. I'm your housekeeper. I can't do that.

268
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:56,366
You're a bit different, you know.

269
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,452
Usually, I'm the one who draws the line.

270
00:14:58,535 --> 00:15:01,246
But between you and me,
it's you who draws the line.

271
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:06,418
Have you seen my watch?

272
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:09,087
Where did you put it?

273
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,881
Probably where I always put.

274
00:15:10,964 --> 00:15:12,591
Then, it must be there.

275
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:15,552
Where did it go? I looked everywhere.
But I can't find it.

276
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:19,556
Gosh. You're the only one
who would touch it.

277
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:34,613
I can only work
until the end of this month.

278
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:38,742
What? You can't tell me that
all of a sudden.

279
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:41,703
You still have 20 days left until then.

280
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:44,039
I'm sure you can find a good housekeeper.

281
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,256
It doesn't smell clean.

282
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:53,882
Did you wash it with hot water?

283
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:57,010
You have such a big house.
I have to clean the second floor, too.

284
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:07,896
Aren't you using too much detergent?

285
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,858
Ma'am, are you not happy with my service?

286
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:14,403
Get back to work.

287
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:30,002
My goodness.
She always moves my things around.

288
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:31,753
I didn't ask her to organize them.

289
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:42,556
Why did your housekeeper recommend
someone like her?

290
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,849
Do you know anyone else?

291
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:48,312
I tried, but I couldn't find anyone.
That's why I asked.

292
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:52,107
No, I'm not that picky.

293
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,610
My previous housekeeper stayed
for over five years.

294
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,618
Ae-suk is working at Mr. Lee's house?

295
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:15,631
Yes. Tomorrow?

296
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:18,175
No, I'm visiting Gyeong-jun
in the military.

297
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,385
You don't need to come with me.

298
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:22,179
Ae-suk.

299
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:24,765
My gosh. What are you doing here?

300
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:27,935
I was walking around the neighborhood.

301
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:29,728
But you hate walking.

302
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,064
I just feel like walking today.

303
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,319
I'll call you back. Okay.

304
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:41,239
Do you need to talk to me?

305
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:47,037
I didn't peg you
as such a coldhearted person.

306
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,956
How could you not even call me?

307
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:51,750
<i>Why would I? I don't work for you anymore.</i>

308
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:53,877
Come back. Work for me again.

309
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:57,172
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:57,255 --> 00:17:59,383
I won't be an exclusive housekeeper.

311
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:01,385
I like working for many families.

312
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:04,721
My kids grew up.
You don't need to work for me exclusively.

313
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:07,057
Tell me when you're free.
I'll make it work.

314
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:12,396
Do you not like me?

315
00:18:14,022 --> 00:18:16,483
Fine. I won't ask again.

316
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:19,486
I don't hate you.

317
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:22,072
<i>If only I could ask
if she is not fond of me then.</i>

318
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,994
You'll get 100,000 won a day,
and you can get off whenever you're done.

319
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:30,580
I'm paying you more
since the house is quite spacious.

320
00:18:31,415 --> 00:18:34,960
If you turn it down, I'll have to think
it's because you hate me.

321
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:40,716
Housekeeping
at the house of my son's friend

322
00:18:41,508 --> 00:18:43,510
wasn't an easy choice for me.

323
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:46,388
Why does that even matter

324
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:48,432
when it's only a job?

325
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,685
But my son encouraged me to take the job

326
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:56,148
and that's how I learned
that he has high self-respect.

327
00:18:57,858 --> 00:18:59,693
I know that he's a sweet boy too.

328
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:05,657
Your house is where
I first worked as a housekeeper.

329
00:19:06,491 --> 00:19:09,286
I learned a lot thanks to my fussy boss,

330
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:10,954
and now I'm in high demand.

331
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:14,458
I didn't come here to hear
how popular you are.

332
00:19:16,251 --> 00:19:18,462
<i>So she wasn't taking a walk.
She came to see me.</i>

333
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:24,009
All I'm saying is that
your family means a lot to me.

334
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:26,720
Will you come back to us or what then?

335
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:29,848
You came here to see me, right?

336
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:35,020
If you need me back so badly,
I'll come back.

337
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:48,950
-Bye.
-Good job today.

338
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:53,038
-Good job, everyone.
-Good job.

339
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,460
<i>Family meeting at 8 p.m.
regarding Gyeong-jun moving out.</i>

340
00:19:58,543 --> 00:20:01,546
<i>Call it today's agenda.
"Gyeong-jun's independence."</i>

341
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,923
<i>Hye-jun, make sure to come.</i>

342
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:07,803
It didn't go as well as I'd imagined.

343
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:11,431
-What's up?
-We're having a family meeting.

344
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:13,266
My family's having dinner too.

345
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,061
-Hae-na got into law school.
-That's great news.

346
00:20:16,144 --> 00:20:17,479
Let's have dinner some time.

347
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:19,648
Us first, though. Any suggestions?

348
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:21,274
What will you have, Jeong-ha?

349
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:23,735
Are you asking me to join you
or choose what to eat?

350
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:26,029
Would we leave you out?
What to eat, of course.

351
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:27,280
Why are you being shy?

352
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:29,533
Because she's your fan.

353
00:20:29,616 --> 00:20:31,868
She's excited just to be with you.

354
00:20:31,952 --> 00:20:33,370
Actually, she isn't anymore.

355
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:35,413
She was quick to fall out of love.

356
00:20:35,497 --> 00:20:38,458
That's how I am.
I can fall in and out of love in a week.

357
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:42,045
Compared to that, I liked you for
quite long. Being the same age helped.

358
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:44,881
You liked me and that's that.
Don't try to justify it.

359
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:48,051
Anyway, <i>jjajangmyeon</i> it is.
You know where.

360
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:50,720
Let's go. Here's our ride.

361
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:52,639
You should go with me.

362
00:20:54,474 --> 00:20:55,809
Did you just grab her?

363
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:57,978
I got carried away.

364
00:20:58,061 --> 00:20:59,938
She's riding with me. I asked her first.

365
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:03,275
She came with me,
so she'll continue to take my car.

366
00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:05,026
I have my own will and preference,

367
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,154
-so I'll ride the car I want.
-Which is mine.

368
00:21:07,237 --> 00:21:09,364
You know you owe me, right?

369
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,742
You'll let me pay you back this way?
Thanks.

370
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:15,120
I won't cash it in yet.

371
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:19,082
I'll go with her, you go with him.

372
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,501
No, you ride with him.
I'll go with my manager.

373
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:22,961
You won't ride with me?

374
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:27,757
You two have fun then.

375
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:30,260
You seem to get childish
around each other,

376
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:31,511
so count me out.

377
00:21:33,513 --> 00:21:35,724
-It's because of you.
-You're easily provoked.

378
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:37,184
I'm childish, that's why.

379
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:39,436
What the hell? Jeez.

380
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,562
-See you later.
-Sure.

381
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:41,897
How have you been?

382
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:49,029
-I'll drive.
-Where are we going?

383
00:21:49,112 --> 00:21:51,198
To eat <i>jjajangmyeon</i>. You don't know where.

384
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:53,450
Fine.

385
00:21:59,956 --> 00:22:00,832
Do you drive?

386
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,959
It's harder to find what I can't do.

387
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:05,086
You didn't seem like the type, but now--

388
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,672
I'm annoying, right?
It's because I'm awesome.

389
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:10,508
What's wrong with him?

390
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:12,302
Sister, please understand.

391
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:14,179
Watching football videos

392
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:17,265
has been boosting his ego
and making him pretentious.

393
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:19,851
You'll soon get used to it.

394
00:22:20,685 --> 00:22:22,771
This isn't right. I got in the wrong car.

395
00:22:22,854 --> 00:22:24,773
-It's too late.
-Too late!

396
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,066
-Good job today.
-Sure.

397
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:31,983
-Take care.
-Bye.

398
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:34,945
Right.

399
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,407
-You did a great job today.
-Take care.

400
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,408
-Thank you.
-Bye.

401
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,286
I'll see you around.

402
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:45,288
Jeez.

403
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:49,418
I think she's a really nice person.

404
00:22:51,878 --> 00:22:53,130
She's so kind.

405
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,008
Do-ha, just honestly say
that you think she's pretty.

406
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:58,719
How can you know her personality?

407
00:22:58,802 --> 00:23:00,303
You're quite thick, aren't you?

408
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:01,805
Sorry?

409
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,391
Also, why do you always
call me by my name?

410
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:08,603
Even some nobody actor
is formally addressed by his manager.

411
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:13,233
I'll get her number for you.

412
00:23:13,316 --> 00:23:17,362
Come on. When did I ever say
I wanted her number?

413
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,451
That darn brat.

414
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,149
My gosh!

415
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:57,360
Are you all right? Gosh, I'm sorry.

416
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:04,326
Why are you so impatient?
You already unfastened your seat belt.

417
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:05,577
What if you got hurt?

418
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:07,829
It wouldn't have been serious.

419
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,539
That's because I held up my arm.

420
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:12,626
Thanks for that.

421
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,836
I might have ended up in the ER.

422
00:24:15,337 --> 00:24:17,631
Accidents can happen anytime and anywhere.

423
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:19,883
It's good to be cautious.

424
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:23,595
Do you remember
how you said I'm patronizing?

425
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:26,765
-No.
-Hye-jun,

426
00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:29,684
you always admitting the truth
is one of your best qualities.

427
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:31,436
Sorry, I do remember.

428
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,939
Well, you're patronizing too.

429
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:36,316
Undoing my seat belt early
isn't worth an earful.

430
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:39,277
You call this an earful?
Want to really get some?

431
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:41,571
Sure, give it to me.

432
00:24:41,655 --> 00:24:42,989
You're not playing fair.

433
00:24:43,073 --> 00:24:44,533
Are you two dating?

434
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:45,784
-Min-jae!
-Min-jae!

435
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:47,619
All right. You don't need to yell.

436
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:50,121
Well, that's how it seems from back here.

437
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,750
I do believe that's mostly
Actor Sa's fault.

438
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:56,086
-His romantic gaze--
-Min-jae, that's enough.

439
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:58,713
It was fun earlier,
but now it's getting old.

440
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:01,341
I thought you two were arguing.

441
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:06,137
We weren't arguing at all.
That was us exchanging our opinions.

442
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:08,098
Right, that's what it was.

443
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:11,393
-Saying that we argued--
-You should get an earful.

444
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:13,186
That's taking it too far.

445
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,605
Right, I guess I crossed the line.

446
00:25:16,106 --> 00:25:17,232
Unbelievable.

447
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,900
I'm hungry. What will you have?

448
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,027
I'll order for you. <i>Jjajang</i> or <i>jjamppong</i>?

449
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:22,362
-<i>Jjajang</i>.
-<i>Jjajang</i>.

450
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:29,911
In the shyest way possible, I say "Jinx."

451
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:36,585
I didn't want to do this,
but someone said that not doing so

452
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,503
will bring you bad luck for three years.

453
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:40,338
It's just a superstition.

454
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,507
Jinx.

455
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,679
You've got to be kidding.

456
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:49,139
It's <i>jjamppong</i> for me!

457
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,935
She really loves <i>jjamppong</i>.

458
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,317
Let me.

459
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,099
You're quite clumsy, you know.

460
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,602
I've never heard that before.

461
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:52,327
Can I borrow your phone?

462
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:53,662
Why?

463
00:26:55,205 --> 00:26:57,374
Can't you just lend it to me
without asking?

464
00:26:57,457 --> 00:26:58,333
Fine.

465
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:08,760
It's not here.

466
00:27:10,303 --> 00:27:11,346
Oh, no.

467
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:15,475
Where did I put it? In the car?

468
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:17,227
Let me think.

469
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:19,980
-It's not the film studio.
-Okay.

470
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:22,399
So where did I put it?

471
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,360
-Open the car door for me.
-No.

472
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,696
Give me the keys then.
Is that not allowed either?

473
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:31,032
It is.

474
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:35,203
Again, you're really clumsy.

475
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:37,664
That's unfair.

476
00:27:38,415 --> 00:27:39,457
What is?

477
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:43,003
No one's ever said that to me before.
I don't need constant care.

478
00:27:43,086 --> 00:27:45,463
I'm the one who usually
takes care of others.

479
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,340
Okay, I believe you.

480
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:49,968
You're not exactly saying that you do.

481
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:51,553
-How's that important?
-It is.

482
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:52,762
Why?

483
00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:54,723
Because I don't want to be like my mom.

484
00:27:55,682 --> 00:27:57,559
Why would you bring up your mom here?

485
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,936
She never did anything to earn my trust.

486
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,440
She divorced my dad
after saying she wouldn't

487
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,610
and married a man with no money
after saying she wouldn't.

488
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:12,782
You sure have a way of telling things
like they're no big deal.

489
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:17,245
Imagine how hard it would've been for me
to come to terms with it.

490
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,705
I even read up on psychology.

491
00:28:19,873 --> 00:28:23,251
Thankfully, my dad and I get along.

492
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:27,589
If we didn't,
I would've been socially awkward.

493
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:30,258
Why would it make you socially awkward?

494
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:32,177
It was fine in my case.

495
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:38,641
You clash with your elders often,
don't you?

496
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:40,226
No, they all adore me.

497
00:28:47,984 --> 00:28:51,196
The owner of the barbecue restaurant
I work part-time at

498
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,073
even wants to leave it to me.

499
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,617
Sure, I believe you.

500
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,535
It's the same as saying you don't!

501
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,418
Fine, I believe you. Happy now?

502
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:09,089
Yes, and I believe you too.

503
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:26,022
All right.

504
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:31,903
Lean forward and
fix the position of the head.

505
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,906
Instead of swinging the club,

506
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:37,617
shift your body weight by using your legs.

507
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:41,371
Nice shot.

508
00:29:41,454 --> 00:29:45,041
That's a good one.
You're ready for the field now.

509
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,543
I'll take you out sometime.

510
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:49,963
Why would I ask you when I have others
who want to take me out?

511
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:53,216
I'm just happy that
your career has taken off.

512
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:55,927
Why are you acting so friendly today?

513
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,555
How can you say that?
We've always been good friends.

514
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:01,015
We've known each other
for quite some time now.

515
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,394
That's true,

516
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:08,523
but all I remember is how
you thought of me as someone beneath you.

517
00:30:11,985 --> 00:30:14,863
The memory makes me so pissed
that I keep missing.

518
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,742
Tae-su, why recall
what happened in the past?

519
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:21,327
-Director Yoon--
-Sir.

520
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:23,913
So tell me.

521
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:27,959
Want to cast Park Do-ha?

522
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:29,461
As if I need to answer that.

523
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:31,004
Just wait.

524
00:30:31,087 --> 00:30:33,840
He'll soon fall for me.

525
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:36,259
I have a way with people, you see.

526
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:39,596
I get how people can change
after finding success,

527
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,140
but you're a completely
different person now.

528
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,393
I once

529
00:30:46,352 --> 00:30:48,897
signed a young actor named Sa Hye-jun.

530
00:30:50,273 --> 00:30:53,318
At first sight,
I was captivated by the aura he had.

531
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:56,321
It wasn't just that he was handsome.

532
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:59,282
He was sweet and generous too.

533
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:12,670
Mr. Lee.

534
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:17,133
I'll stay with you.

535
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:21,012
I believe it when you say that

536
00:31:22,805 --> 00:31:24,766
-the sun will soon rise.
-Thank you.

537
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,144
<i>I really thought</i>

538
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:32,106
<i>it was impossible
for someone like him not to make it.</i>

539
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:36,486
<i>How absurd is it
for his career not to take off?</i>

540
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:38,238
But it didn't.

541
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:41,824
It didn't. It was all just a dream.

542
00:31:42,408 --> 00:31:46,079
I was happy while hoping
for his career to take off,

543
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:50,625
but I realized
it was just an empty illusion.

544
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,835
Life is far from it.

545
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,546
You have a family to provide for.

546
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:56,172
That's when I realized it.

547
00:31:57,423 --> 00:32:00,802
The world is dominated
by the bad and the ugly.

548
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:03,012
So what can I do but become one of them?

549
00:32:03,096 --> 00:32:04,222
See?

550
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:08,017
You need a backstory like this
to justify one's change,

551
00:32:08,101 --> 00:32:11,354
but you're just trying to take
the shortcut now.

552
00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:15,024
Shouldn't you at least apologize
for what you did to me?

553
00:32:15,108 --> 00:32:18,111
Although, I'm not asking for an apology.

554
00:32:18,194 --> 00:32:21,072
I don't want a belated apology anyway.

555
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:23,533
So are you saying
you'll let me cast him or not?

556
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:25,326
Only if my company can co-produce it.

557
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:29,038
I heard about how you were
offered company shares.

558
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:32,208
Good. Why don't we grab some drinks then?

559
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:34,002
I've been cutting back.

560
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,838
I want to enjoy this good life
for a long time.

561
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:50,810
Have you eaten?

562
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:52,478
-Not yet.
-We have. Wait.

563
00:32:53,313 --> 00:32:55,356
You're on board with me moving out, right?

564
00:32:56,232 --> 00:32:58,276
I don't give a damn, so do as you wish.

565
00:33:00,153 --> 00:33:02,155
Once I leave, you'll get my room.

566
00:33:02,238 --> 00:33:04,574
It's just absurd how a grown man
doesn't have

567
00:33:04,657 --> 00:33:05,491
his own room.

568
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:08,328
Noted.

569
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:13,499
I'm saying you should tell Mom
that you want your own room.

570
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,501
What am I, a fussy brat?

571
00:33:15,585 --> 00:33:17,754
It'll help sell my case to Mom.

572
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:30,183
-Need any help?
-Not really.

573
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:31,809
Ask your father to join us.

574
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:35,104
-Dad!
-Ask him face to face.

575
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:37,231
He doesn't want to see me.

576
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:38,983
That's absurd.

577
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:41,611
Parents don't hold grudges
against their kids.

578
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:53,164
Dad, you're to join the family meeting.

579
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:55,291
Right, got it. Hey, Hye-jun.

580
00:33:57,877 --> 00:34:00,338
What do you think about this book?

581
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:02,256
Have you seen your mom read this?

582
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,341
Yes, many times.

583
00:34:05,134 --> 00:34:06,302
Jeez.

584
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:09,138
-Why?
-Why what?

585
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,224
I mean,

586
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:15,520
Gyeong-jun says
it's one of those books, you know.

587
00:34:16,979 --> 00:34:21,651
A girl from a poor family works
as a housekeeper at some house.

588
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:23,528
And she and her male boss…

589
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:27,490
No, forget about it.

590
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,243
It's embarrassing to ask my own son this.

591
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,623
Dad.

592
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:38,543
Do you know why Mom likes this book?

593
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:39,919
Do you?

594
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:43,381
<i>GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING</i>

595
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:56,060
Is it that intriguing?

596
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:56,978
What?

597
00:34:57,645 --> 00:34:58,855
What is it about?

598
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,149
Don't know. I haven't finished it.

599
00:35:02,191 --> 00:35:03,860
But you've read it so many times.

600
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:07,613
I'm just like her.

601
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:10,533
-In what way?
-Look.

602
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,120
When she cleans,
she puts everything back where it was.

603
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,039
Is this why you love this book?

604
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:20,793
Yes. This has been my rule
since I started housekeeping,

605
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:23,546
but I didn't know
if I was doing the right thing.

606
00:35:23,629 --> 00:35:25,798
This book tells me that I was right.

607
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:28,718
-That's why you like it?
-Yes.

608
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:33,389
I had the same idea as this author.

609
00:35:33,473 --> 00:35:35,057
I may not be a writer,

610
00:35:35,141 --> 00:35:37,143
but I can relate to its content.

611
00:35:37,852 --> 00:35:39,479
Don't I seem intelligent?

612
00:35:43,024 --> 00:35:45,651
Isn't it hard to work as a housekeeper?

613
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,740
No job in this world is easy.

614
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,993
We have it rough from birth,

615
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:58,331
so all we can do
is find our own fun in life.

616
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:03,002
Son, the same goes for you too.

617
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:05,755
No one hands it out for free.

618
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,182
-Honey?
-Oh.

619
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:18,434
All right.

620
00:36:18,518 --> 00:36:20,102
Hae-na, the law school…

621
00:36:20,186 --> 00:36:22,313
Well, you were a shoo-in.
But I'm still happy.

622
00:36:23,231 --> 00:36:26,025
You're following the path
I have laid out for you.

623
00:36:27,443 --> 00:36:30,655
Hae-hyo, you're following the path
your mom laid out,

624
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,657
which worries me but--

625
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,618
That's not how you give a toast.

626
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:38,955
It's supposed to be
a speech of celebration.

627
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:40,206
Let me do it instead.

628
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:43,292
It's rude to cut people off mid-sentence.

629
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:45,920
Know that she just
diminished my authority.

630
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,923
One's authority
can't be diminished by others,

631
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,716
so consider it intact.

632
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:54,387
See how sweet my creations are?

633
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,013
You mean, "our" creations.

634
00:36:56,097 --> 00:36:59,183
That may be true, but you don't own us.

635
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:02,770
Do you have to draw the line like that?

636
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:06,148
We'll never think that we own you.
Just live your life well.

637
00:37:06,232 --> 00:37:08,776
Congratulations
on getting into law school.

638
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,863
May you become someone who contributes
to the country and society.

639
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:14,073
Gosh, that's so dry.

640
00:37:14,156 --> 00:37:17,076
I just want you guys to have fun
and enjoy your lives.

641
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,036
Don't worry even if things don't go well.

642
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,499
You have us. We'll always be by your side.
Both I and your dad.

643
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:26,127
Cheers.

644
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,009
We rarely do this
even though we live together.

645
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:34,927
Because we all have different schedules.

646
00:37:35,011 --> 00:37:37,179
I'm against Gyeong-jun moving out.

647
00:37:37,263 --> 00:37:39,640
You can't bring that up so abruptly.

648
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,267
Mom, why are you against it?

649
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,604
He's on salary. There's a limit
to how much money he can earn.

650
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:47,106
On top of the living expenses,
900,000 won on rent?

651
00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:49,150
Then he'll never save any money.

652
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,360
We can't buy you an apartment,

653
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:53,571
but you can spend less
if you live with us.

654
00:37:53,654 --> 00:37:55,656
Save enough money for a rent deposit.

655
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,908
You can move out then.

656
00:37:56,991 --> 00:38:00,202
Mom, in the past 27 years of my life,

657
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:01,954
I've never had fun.

658
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:04,999
I just need to be responsible
for myself now as I'm single,

659
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,375
so I want to have fun.

660
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:08,461
Why must you move out to do that?

661
00:38:08,544 --> 00:38:10,129
Are you uncomfortable around here?

662
00:38:10,212 --> 00:38:11,756
Think about Hye-jun.

663
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,800
He needs his own room.
Sharing a room with Grandpa can't be nice.

664
00:38:14,884 --> 00:38:18,179
You're talking as if I'm uncomfortable
sharing the room with Grandpa.

665
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,806
Say what you want to say,
but don't drag me into it.

666
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,642
You said that back in middle school.

667
00:38:22,725 --> 00:38:24,226
Why bring that up now?

668
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,229
We fought since you didn't let me
use the computer.

669
00:38:27,313 --> 00:38:29,106
-But it's true.
-No, it's not.

670
00:38:30,316 --> 00:38:32,860
You put words in my mouth.

671
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,363
You're clouding the issue,
and you got me upset.

672
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,824
I never said I was uncomfortable
sharing the room with Grandpa.

673
00:38:38,908 --> 00:38:41,118
You hurt Grandpa's feelings
and made me look bad.

674
00:38:41,702 --> 00:38:44,497
-When did you get so eloquent?
-It's all thanks to you.

675
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,333
You always lecture me
using difficult words and all.

676
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:50,211
Why is it that you guys fight
every time you see each other?

677
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:54,215
You used to care a lot about each other.
I have to say, you're the problem.

678
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:57,176
How could you talk back
to your big brother like that?

679
00:38:57,259 --> 00:38:59,845
All siblings are equal.

680
00:38:59,929 --> 00:39:02,139
They ought to respect each other.

681
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:03,891
The young learn from the old.

682
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,143
Embrace and look after
your little brother.

683
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:08,020
You used to adore Yeong-gyun.

684
00:39:08,104 --> 00:39:09,772
Why bring up Yeong-gyun now?

685
00:39:09,855 --> 00:39:13,943
Because you talked about
how siblings should be.

686
00:39:14,026 --> 00:39:16,362
Why aren't you eating, Father?

687
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:18,781
I have something to say too.

688
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,035
Gyeong-jun doesn't take after me.

689
00:39:23,953 --> 00:39:25,871
I thought he did,

690
00:39:25,955 --> 00:39:27,873
but I was wrong.

691
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:29,959
I think

692
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:33,004
Hye-jun got my looks,

693
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:35,006
and Yeong-nam got my personality.

694
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:36,590
Me? Dad!

695
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,968
You just don't know me well enough yet.

696
00:39:39,051 --> 00:39:41,303
What? I've known you for over 50 years.

697
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:44,557
I used to be vain and pretentious,
but not anymore.

698
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:49,729
Gyeong-jun wants to move out
so he can live comfortably all by himself.

699
00:39:49,812 --> 00:39:51,814
There was a time
when I wasn't at home much,

700
00:39:51,897 --> 00:39:55,359
but it was never because I only cared
about my comfort and well-being.

701
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:59,405
I made a mistake because
I wasn't thoughtful and mature enough.

702
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,824
Grandpa.

703
00:40:02,575 --> 00:40:04,994
I'm not moving out
so I can live comfortably.

704
00:40:05,077 --> 00:40:08,080
If I move out, there will be more space
for everyone else,

705
00:40:08,164 --> 00:40:11,500
which means all of you can live
in a better environment.

706
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:13,252
Hye-jun and I started fighting

707
00:40:13,335 --> 00:40:16,589
because he kept invading my space
as he never had his own.

708
00:40:16,672 --> 00:40:19,425
I couldn't control my emotions
during my adolescent years,

709
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:21,677
so we fought.
And we're still butting heads

710
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:24,472
because of the pent-up emotions
from that time.

711
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,766
This isn't anyone's fault.

712
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:28,934
Poverty is to blame.

713
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:32,229
Now, I can afford to move out.
And it will solve this problem.

714
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:34,607
Hye-jun and I will stop fighting.

715
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,193
That is why I arrived at this decision.

716
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,654
You really are our family's brain.

717
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,573
We started fighting

718
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:45,409
because I kept invading your space
and got you angry?

719
00:40:45,493 --> 00:40:48,162
Jeez, you still don't know
what you did wrong.

720
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,998
We can talk later.
We should focus on the meeting now.

721
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:54,126
Why must you always rebel
against your older brother?

722
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,961
That's not what he's doing.

723
00:40:56,045 --> 00:40:58,130
Gyeong-jun is all talk.

724
00:40:58,214 --> 00:41:01,926
He's just trying to justify himself
wanting to move out.

725
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:04,720
I know because I've been duped
by punks like him many times.

726
00:41:04,804 --> 00:41:07,640
They bewitch you with words
and make you believe them.

727
00:41:07,723 --> 00:41:09,475
Grandpa, why are you doing this to me?

728
00:41:09,558 --> 00:41:11,727
Because you're so unbelievably persuasive.

729
00:41:12,228 --> 00:41:14,897
I am very proud of you. But you know what?

730
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,732
Con artists are extremely persuasive.

731
00:41:17,316 --> 00:41:19,527
Dad, aren't you embarrassed?

732
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,863
Are you bragging about getting conned?
You sound very proud.

733
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,907
I already paid for everything.

734
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,118
What are you talking about? How?

735
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:30,746
By always putting up with you
talking down to me in front of everyone!

736
00:41:39,255 --> 00:41:40,172
Hey.

737
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,509
There's no worse punishment
than having to put up

738
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:47,680
with your child
talking down to you all the time.

739
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,395
Oh, dear.

740
00:41:59,942 --> 00:42:01,110
Grandpa.

741
00:42:08,701 --> 00:42:10,494
If you want to move out, go ahead.

742
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:13,789
But the rent has to be lower,
around 300,000 to 400,000 won.

743
00:42:13,873 --> 00:42:16,417
Why couldn't you have been like this
from the get-go?

744
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,128
-So?
-Mom said I can move out.

745
00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:22,798
Gosh, what do we do, though?
Father heard everything we said.

746
00:42:22,882 --> 00:42:25,342
What do we do? My gosh, what should I do?

747
00:42:25,426 --> 00:42:26,302
What did I say?

748
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:29,054
I bet Grandpa feels
most betrayed by you, Mom.

749
00:42:29,138 --> 00:42:32,308
Your words totally contradict
how you usually treat him.

750
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:34,143
Are you enjoying this or what?

751
00:42:34,226 --> 00:42:35,644
Why take it out on me?

752
00:42:35,728 --> 00:42:38,606
Grandpa was mean to me.
He basically called me selfish.

753
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,524
He was just stating the fact.

754
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:43,986
Honey, go apologize to Father.

755
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:45,279
Why should I?

756
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:46,906
Gosh, enough.

757
00:42:46,989 --> 00:42:49,325
It happened years ago,
so stop holding a grudge.

758
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:51,702
I can't. It still makes me angry.
What can I do?

759
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:53,245
So you'll keep this up?

760
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:54,872
We're parents too.

761
00:42:54,955 --> 00:42:57,082
What will the boys learn?

762
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,835
We never did them wrong.
I'm not like my dad.

763
00:42:59,919 --> 00:43:01,754
Comparing Dad with him is insulting.

764
00:43:13,682 --> 00:43:15,517
-Hye-jun.
-Yes?

765
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:17,603
I'm going to become a model.

766
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:21,565
You've made up your mind?

767
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:25,819
Yes. I'll become a successful model

768
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,989
and show your dad what his father can do.

769
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,617
You can do it.

770
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,868
I can do it!

771
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:35,579
You already got your spirits back up.

772
00:43:35,663 --> 00:43:37,414
This is why I love you, Grandpa.

773
00:43:37,498 --> 00:43:40,417
Your grandpa is a charming man,
you little rascal.

774
00:43:43,629 --> 00:43:46,048
Could you give us a minute, Hye-jun?

775
00:43:52,471 --> 00:43:55,140
Father, I'm sorry.

776
00:43:55,224 --> 00:44:00,062
It's okay. People even bad-mouth the king
behind his back.

777
00:44:01,021 --> 00:44:04,775
But you know,
Gyeong-jun really doesn't take after me.

778
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:07,903
Gyeong-jun takes after me.
Why would he take after his grandpa?

779
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:12,074
And I don't take after you.
Our personalities are very different.

780
00:44:12,157 --> 00:44:16,870
Don't deny it.
Personality-wise, you're just like me.

781
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:21,667
-Gosh, you're driving me nuts.
-I just hope to win the lottery

782
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,503
-so that I can move out.
-Dad!

783
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:38,434
So I'm moving out.
You're happy about that, right?

784
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,104
I'm happy to finally have my own room.

785
00:44:42,187 --> 00:44:43,814
Stop by my office sometime.

786
00:44:43,897 --> 00:44:45,274
I'll buy you lunch.

787
00:44:45,357 --> 00:44:46,358
Okay.

788
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:49,987
Hey.

789
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:53,949
I'm trying to be nice.
Shouldn't you bow down a little?

790
00:44:54,033 --> 00:44:54,950
What do you mean?

791
00:44:55,617 --> 00:44:56,452
Why should I?

792
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:59,038
-You little brat.
-What?

793
00:44:59,788 --> 00:45:02,541
Want to punch me?
I won't let you punch me anymore.

794
00:45:04,376 --> 00:45:05,419
I said I'm sorry.

795
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:06,962
That doesn't mean anything.

796
00:45:07,046 --> 00:45:08,672
You really hold grudges.

797
00:45:08,756 --> 00:45:10,632
I'll let it all go if you're good to me.

798
00:45:10,716 --> 00:45:12,092
But you keep messing with me.

799
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:15,137
No, I'm just worried about you.
That's all.

800
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,764
We're in the same boat.

801
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,223
I don't buy it.

802
00:45:18,307 --> 00:45:20,642
I think you always had it easier
than I did.

803
00:45:21,935 --> 00:45:22,936
You had your own room.

-Okay.
-What's okay?

827
00:48:03,472 --> 00:48:05,015
I see the two stamps.

828
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:09,353
Okay, you just wait. Soon, I'll… You know?

829
00:48:09,436 --> 00:48:11,355
Gosh, look at you all excited.

830
00:48:24,576 --> 00:48:28,038
Gosh, even I'm nervous.
This scene has to turn out nicely.

831
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,332
Did you sleep well?

832
00:48:30,415 --> 00:48:31,750
Yes, I did.

833
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:36,838
You don't seem nervous at all.
You look too calm.

834
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:41,218
I just kept thinking
about my character, Su-yeong.

835
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:43,136
Then he started talking to me.

836
00:48:46,181 --> 00:48:48,850
You're a true actor now.
Your character is speaking to you.

837
00:48:49,434 --> 00:48:51,228
That sounded very insincere.

838
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:52,354
It showed?

839
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:56,817
I don't really get it.
I mean, I'm not an actor.

840
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,321
Anyway, I'm happy to hear
that you're so immersed in your role.

841
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:03,573
I can't be on set today, so I was worried.

842
00:49:03,657 --> 00:49:04,700
I can stop worrying.

843
00:49:05,784 --> 00:49:07,577
What does Director Yoon want?

844
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:10,163
What do you think?
I bet he wants to give you a role.

845
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,666
His most recent movie
didn't do well at all.

846
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:15,127
Down and up, you know?
This time, it'll do well.

847
00:49:15,794 --> 00:49:18,797
And guess what!
He seems to be very fond of you.

848
00:49:19,381 --> 00:49:22,634
Don't you think things are going well
for you now that I'm your manager?

849
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,929
So you want credit. I like that.

850
00:49:56,892 --> 00:49:59,645
Hey, Jeong-ha.

851
00:50:00,312 --> 00:50:01,688
My jaw dropped.

852
00:50:02,314 --> 00:50:04,024
Sa Hye-jun got changed.

853
00:50:05,025 --> 00:50:05,901
What about it?

854
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,945
He looks like a prince.

855
00:50:08,904 --> 00:50:11,990
You know what they say.
"The face completes the fashion."

856
00:50:12,074 --> 00:50:14,743
I didn't know before,
but he's ridiculously handsome.

857
00:50:16,036 --> 00:50:19,373
You didn't know all this time?
You do not have a good eye.

858
00:50:19,456 --> 00:50:21,083
-I do.
-You don't.

859
00:50:23,335 --> 00:50:25,712
Why are you here, Su-bin?
Shouldn't you be working?

860
00:50:25,796 --> 00:50:27,422
Oh, I'm sorry.

861
00:50:28,006 --> 00:50:31,218
At least you're saying sorry. You're not
making excuses like someone.

862
00:50:31,718 --> 00:50:34,513
You must be thrilled
about visiting the set.

863
00:50:35,597 --> 00:50:37,140
I'm going there to work.

864
00:50:41,103 --> 00:50:43,730
Then I'll get back to work too.

865
00:50:45,816 --> 00:50:46,692
Wait.

866
00:50:48,902 --> 00:50:49,778
Yes?

867
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:52,447
Choose your side wisely.

868
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,368
Oh, don't worry.

869
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:58,537
I started working a year ago, so I know.

870
00:51:05,878 --> 00:51:07,754
My gosh, you guys look so great together.

871
00:51:10,966 --> 00:51:12,467
He'll beat me up today.

872
00:51:12,551 --> 00:51:14,386
Why run off with my money to begin with?

873
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:16,805
Yes, Jin-seong deserves to get beaten up.

874
00:51:16,889 --> 00:51:18,640
Why run off with someone else's money?

875
00:51:18,724 --> 00:51:21,602
Su-yeong is a corporate heir,
but he's too violent.

876
00:51:22,352 --> 00:51:25,772
Are you sure you can do it?
I can't even picture you hitting someone.

877
00:51:26,356 --> 00:51:28,650
I can't do it, but Su-yeong can.

878
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:33,822
I don't feel confident.

879
00:51:35,073 --> 00:51:37,159
-Aren't you heading out?
-Yes, in five minutes.

880
00:51:37,242 --> 00:51:38,577
I see. What should I do?

881
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,454
Just watch the shoot and go home?

882
00:51:40,537 --> 00:51:43,916
Well, I'm going to watch
Hye-jun's fight scene with Park Do-ha.

883
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,043
Then I'll go with you.

884
00:51:48,795 --> 00:51:49,922
Gosh.

885
00:51:53,216 --> 00:51:54,593
-Let's go.
-Okay.

886
00:52:02,893 --> 00:52:03,810
No. Hand that over.

887
00:52:04,478 --> 00:52:07,814
This is how you do it.
The chest, the stomach,

888
00:52:08,732 --> 00:52:10,776
and the back. Hit him in that order.

889
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:12,027
Got it.

890
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:14,488
Do better. How many times
have we done this already?

891
00:52:15,489 --> 00:52:17,449
I'm trying to make sure
you won't get hurt.

892
00:52:21,244 --> 00:52:22,621
Stop. Look, Do-ha.

893
00:52:22,704 --> 00:52:25,540
When he hits you in the chest
and stomach, respond accordingly.

894
00:52:26,124 --> 00:52:27,668
I don't need to practice that.

895
00:52:27,751 --> 00:52:28,835
I'll try that again.

896
00:52:28,919 --> 00:52:29,962
Okay, go.

897
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:32,923
I'll finish it in one go.

898
00:52:47,562 --> 00:52:49,272
That's how you do it. Hit him hard.

899
00:52:49,356 --> 00:52:51,024
He's like a different person.

900
00:52:51,108 --> 00:52:52,609
He's an actor indeed.

901
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:56,279
Was I like this too?
During my shoot earlier.

902
00:52:57,531 --> 00:52:59,825
Yes, you looked like a real actor too.

903
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:08,166
Exhale.

904
00:53:09,626 --> 00:53:11,753
Keep going. Get a nice stretch.

905
00:53:11,837 --> 00:53:14,548
Now, the other way.
We'll go the other way.

906
00:53:14,631 --> 00:53:17,175
Get a nice stretch.

907
00:53:17,259 --> 00:53:18,552
The other arm.

908
00:53:18,635 --> 00:53:21,513
Rotate your hips, making big circles.

909
00:53:21,596 --> 00:53:24,808
If you're done warming up,
I'll now correct your postures.

910
00:53:25,475 --> 00:53:26,685
-Good.
-Thank you.

911
00:53:28,937 --> 00:53:30,814
-Relax your shoulders.
-Okay.

912
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:36,445
It's okay. It's very important
to be careful at the beginning.

913
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,410
Are you all right?

914
00:53:50,917 --> 00:53:51,918
<i>Hello.</i>

915
00:53:52,002 --> 00:53:52,919
<i>-Sir!
-Sir!</i>

916
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:56,965
I'm not a thug.

917
00:53:58,216 --> 00:53:59,885
Why would I hit you with a stick?

918
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,557
Hey, that's not your line.

919
00:54:06,183 --> 00:54:08,435
I'm sorry.
I don't know where that came from.

920
00:54:11,271 --> 00:54:14,024
Jeez, it's so frustrating
to work with a total rookie.

921
00:54:14,107 --> 00:54:15,067
Hye-jun.

922
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,943
Yes. I'm sorry, sir.

923
00:54:18,153 --> 00:54:19,654
I actually like that.

924
00:54:19,738 --> 00:54:22,324
Director, then the focus will be on him.

925
00:54:22,407 --> 00:54:23,533
I'm the lead.

926
00:54:23,617 --> 00:54:26,078
It'll only help your character shine more.

927
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:27,579
What were you going to do next?

928
00:54:28,246 --> 00:54:30,582
Untying him
and punching the crap out of him

929
00:54:30,665 --> 00:54:32,709
would make my character
look more ruthless.

930
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,294
You think so?

931
00:54:34,836 --> 00:54:36,838
Let's try it. Can you guys untie him?

932
00:54:36,922 --> 00:54:38,256
-Untie him.
-Okay.

933
00:54:39,549 --> 00:54:40,383
Ouch, that hurts.

934
00:54:44,221 --> 00:54:46,181
Do you want to try punching him once?

935
00:54:46,264 --> 00:54:47,724
-Punch him?
-Give it a go.

936
00:55:18,964 --> 00:55:22,008
Director, thank you for thinking
so highly of Hye-jun.

937
00:55:22,551 --> 00:55:25,095
-We'll do our best.
-You know Lee Tae-su, right?

938
00:55:25,178 --> 00:55:28,014
Of course. I used to work
for his company, you know.

939
00:55:28,098 --> 00:55:31,393
He spoke very highly of Hye-jun.

940
00:55:31,476 --> 00:55:33,728
So I looked him up,
and he's pretty good indeed.

941
00:55:33,812 --> 00:55:35,647
Oh, I see.

942
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:39,943
Who's playing the lead character?

943
00:55:40,026 --> 00:55:43,238
Jessica is our female lead.
And I'm in talks with Park Do-ha.

944
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:45,115
Jessica and Park Do-ha?

945
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,617
My, such huge names!

946
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:50,704
Did that hurt?

947
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:53,373
It did, you son of a bitch.

948
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:56,626
You're such a thug.

949
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:59,421
Thugs only inflict pain on others.

950
00:55:59,504 --> 00:56:01,673
Compared to that, I'm incredibly humane.

951
00:56:03,675 --> 00:56:07,846
I'm sharing this pain with you.

952
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:08,763
You know?

953
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:14,644
Don't be so cocky.
Without your parents, you're a nobody.

954
00:56:23,612 --> 00:56:24,446
Are you okay?

955
00:56:24,988 --> 00:56:26,531
-Let go.
-Hey, I'm sorry.

956
00:56:26,615 --> 00:56:27,699
Let go.

957
00:56:30,493 --> 00:56:34,164
That was intentional, wasn't it?
You did that to screw me over.

958
00:56:34,247 --> 00:56:36,833
No, it was just a mistake.
Did it hurt a lot?

959
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:39,544
Let's take a break.

960
00:56:40,462 --> 00:56:42,297
Are you sure this is better?

961
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,633
The director thinks that it is.

962
00:56:44,716 --> 00:56:46,593
Directors aren't always right.

963
00:56:47,594 --> 00:56:50,138
Director, I want to watch
what we shot just now.

964
00:56:53,558 --> 00:56:55,727
-Why are you following me?
-I should see it too.

965
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:58,438
No, don't do anything.
You're getting on my nerves.

966
00:56:58,522 --> 00:57:01,650
Take it out on me after the shoot.
Right now, let's work.

967
00:57:01,733 --> 00:57:03,860
I don't even want to see you
after the shoot.

968
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,948
Gosh, I don't need this. Get this off me.

969
00:57:08,823 --> 00:57:09,824
<i>Backswing.</i>

970
00:57:10,325 --> 00:57:13,578
-<i>And hit the ball.</i>
-Look at that. Her arm is straight.

971
00:57:15,163 --> 00:57:16,373
It looks easy, but…

972
00:57:16,456 --> 00:57:18,041
Hello, sir.

973
00:57:29,886 --> 00:57:32,389
What's up? You talked as if
you'd never see me again.

974
00:57:32,472 --> 00:57:34,516
What brings you all the way here?

975
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:36,393
It's for your kids.

976
00:57:36,476 --> 00:57:37,602
What's with you today?

977
00:57:37,686 --> 00:57:41,189
I've realized that
you actually have a warm side.

978
00:57:41,273 --> 00:57:44,651
I met Director Yoon.
He said you spoke highly of Hye-jun.

979
00:57:45,277 --> 00:57:46,695
Thank you so much.

980
00:57:48,655 --> 00:57:51,408
That's right. I did.

981
00:57:51,491 --> 00:57:55,704
He's filming that movie with Do-ha,
and they'll also be in the same drama.

982
00:57:55,787 --> 00:57:57,664
I'm pleasantly surprised by you.

983
00:57:58,582 --> 00:57:59,791
You'll be a great manager.

984
00:58:00,792 --> 00:58:02,252
My gosh!

985
00:58:02,335 --> 00:58:04,004
-Come on.
-Really, I mean it.

986
00:58:04,087 --> 00:58:06,631
Gosh, thank you for the compliment.

987
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:10,010
As someone with a lot more experience
in the industry,

988
00:58:10,093 --> 00:58:12,721
please help me out and guide me.

989
00:58:13,513 --> 00:58:16,308
Yes, I'll be sure to provide you
with guidance and help.

990
00:58:16,391 --> 00:58:20,186
By the way,
I heard they're still shooting.

991
00:58:20,729 --> 00:58:21,896
Do you know why?

992
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,691
Well, maybe Hye-jun's passion

993
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:27,611
moved the crew to tears.

994
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,530
What a nutjob.

995
00:58:30,614 --> 00:58:32,657
Gosh, hey.

996
00:58:33,783 --> 00:58:37,412
I can't believe I didn't know
that you were such a nutjob.

997
00:58:37,495 --> 00:58:39,998
Same here. Even I didn't know.

998
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,875
I hope we get along well.

999
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,251
Sure thing.

I insisted?

1027
01:02:06,955 --> 01:02:10,291
Yes, you did.
I clearly told you to just go home.

1028
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:11,918
Are you evading responsibility?

1029
01:02:12,544 --> 01:02:15,588

I had nothing to do with your injury.

Why are you worked up?

Yes, I do.

1033
01:02:21,886 --> 01:02:24,264
So you want to be responsible too?

1034
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,726
You sound a little crazy right now.

1035
01:02:29,227 --> 01:02:32,063
How did you know?
I think I'm a little crazy today.

1036
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:38,611
Yes.

1037
01:02:45,952 --> 01:02:47,996
All the waiting must've tired you out.

1038
01:02:49,372 --> 01:02:50,832
I'm not tired.

1039
01:02:51,332 --> 01:02:54,669
But I've realized that
no job in this world is easy.

1040
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:58,590
I was very excited today.

1041
01:02:59,799 --> 01:03:02,176
So excited that I couldn't even think
about anything.

1042
01:03:04,846 --> 01:03:06,723
Does it feel different when you're

1043
01:03:06,806 --> 01:03:09,434
the one living the moment
as opposed to just spectating it?

1044
01:03:10,852 --> 01:03:11,853
Probably?

1045
01:03:17,817 --> 01:03:19,861
Oh, it's raining.

1046
01:03:21,362 --> 01:03:23,573
Gosh, it's so weird.

1047
01:03:23,656 --> 01:03:26,034
Every time I'm with you, it rains.

1048
01:03:29,037 --> 01:03:30,038
You're right.

1049
01:03:40,673 --> 01:03:42,675
Why are you standing there? Run!

1050
01:03:51,893 --> 01:03:53,019
I want to get rained on.

1051
01:03:58,066 --> 01:04:01,402
You'll be cold.
You said you're a rational person.

1052
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:07,867
-I feel like I'll explode.
-Let's take shelter first.

1053
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:09,035
I'm conflicted.

1054
01:04:10,453 --> 01:04:12,205
There's something I want to say,

1055
01:04:13,122 --> 01:04:14,874
but I don't know if I should say it.

1056
01:04:14,958 --> 01:04:18,211
Well… When you're not sure
whether or not you should say something,

1057
01:04:18,795 --> 01:04:19,796
just don't say it.

1058
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:22,924
I'll say it.

1059
01:04:25,885 --> 01:04:27,679
-To me?
-I think I like…

1060
01:04:29,347 --> 01:04:30,264
What?

1061
01:04:34,268 --> 01:04:35,395
I think I like you.

1062

RECORD OF YOUTH

1064
01:05:40,668 --> 01:05:41,753
<i>How about a movie?</i>

1065
01:05:41,836 --> 01:05:45,965
<i>And being together right now
doesn't feel real, either.</i>

1066
01:05:46,049 --> 01:05:47,341
He'll be in a mini-series.

1067
01:05:47,425 --> 01:05:50,845
Act like you know nothing
until he tells you first.

1068
01:05:50,928 --> 01:05:52,805
I will try to get in your way.

1069
01:05:52,889 --> 01:05:54,849
<i>I don't deserve to be your manager.</i>

1070
01:05:54,932 --> 01:05:56,684
<i>A manager I can't get a hold of
is the worst.</i>

1071
01:05:57,185 --> 01:05:58,686
<i>Want to grab dinner together?</i>

1072
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:00,021
I have plans this evening

1073
01:06:01,022 --> 01:06:02,231
<i>with Hye-jun.</i>

1074
01:06:02,315 --> 01:06:03,149
<i>Grandpa!</i>
