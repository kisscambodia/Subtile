RECORD OF YOUTH

00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:07,705
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS AN
"EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT" AND IS SUPPORTED

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,570
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, TOURISM
AND THE KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

4
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:31,311
“I can’t believe I got this lucky.

5
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:36,483
This is such an exciting moment
of my life.

6
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:39,277
Living an honest life paid off.

7
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:44,783
I should be grateful.”
Scratch all of that. Damn it.

8
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:50,038
But why was Hye-jun so handsome today?

9
00:00:57,713 --> 00:01:01,550
Living an honest life doesn't mean
I'll be happy in life.

10
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:09,349
Nasty people who don’t care about others

11
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:11,393
always win in this life.

12
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:20,694
But I’m so glad
that I decided to be your fan.

13
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:25,490
Are you my fan?

14
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:32,581
What?

15
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:40,338
Do you like me?

16
00:01:58,857 --> 00:01:59,900
No.

17
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,197
You probably have to say that.
I understand.

18
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:07,783
No, I’m really not your fan.

19
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:10,660
Okay. I'll believe you.

20
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,497
But I have better photos, you know.

21
00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:16,208
Come on.

22
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,710
Okay. I got it. I said you’re not my fan.

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,714
-I wasn’t going to say anything.
-Gosh.

24
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:24,049
You can say it.

25
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,135
I’m Won Hae-hyo’s fan.

26
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:30,555
Pardon?

27
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,933
I want Won Hae-hyo.

28
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:34,935
Look. There are two people.

29
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:36,853
How could you be sure that I’m your fan?

30
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:44,820
Right. Why was I so sure?

31
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:47,989
Were you hoping I'd be your fan?

32
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:51,076
No, I wasn't.
I was mistaken that you were my fan.

33
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:57,165
I can see how it could be misleading.

34
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,668
I feel less humiliated now.

35
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:03,588
I hate misunderstanding people.

36
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:11,429
No way.

37
00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:12,931
-Hae-hyo.
-I'm your fan.

38
00:03:13,014 --> 00:03:14,391
-Can we take a photo?
-Oh, my.

39
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:16,518
-You're so handsome.
-You're so hot.

40
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:18,603
-Can we take a photo?
-With my phone, please!

41
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:20,564
-You're so handsome.
-One, two, three.

42
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:22,232
-My gosh.
-You're so handsome.

43
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:23,817
-Can we take a photo, too?
-All right.

44
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,778
That’s the last one, and let him go now.

45
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:29,364
I’m his mother.
Please don’t get any wrong ideas.

46
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:31,324
-You're beautiful!
-Bye.

47
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:32,409
-Ma'am!
-I love you.

48
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:34,411
I'll be your daughter-in-law!

49
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:40,792
-What did you need to give me?
-Congratulations.

50
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,211
-On what?
-Did you not hear yet?

51
00:03:43,753 --> 00:03:45,505
You got the role.

52
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:48,550
You’ll finally be in Choi Se-hun’s movie!

53
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:51,887
But how did you find out?

54
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,223
-I called them.
-You're such a Mama Bear.

55
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:57,142
No, I'm just taking care of you.

56
00:03:57,225 --> 00:03:58,476
You’re my creation.

57
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,395
I’m investing all I’ve got in you.

58
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,022
You should invest in yourself.

59
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:04,274
Who knows? I might betray you later.

60
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:05,567
I doubt that you can

61
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,944
once you find out
everything I've done for you.

62
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:10,947
-I need to move out.
-Hey.

63
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:12,824
I need to get back in now.

64
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:17,829
Aren’t you happy? You got the role!

65
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:19,664
I thought you would be really excited.

66
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:21,082
It’s complicated.

67
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:23,877
Is it because of Hye-jun?

68
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:34,846
You must have been nervous earlier.

69
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,765
Why?

70
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:39,893
You met your star for the first time.

71
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:41,603
And you got to touch him, too.

72
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:43,438
It wasn't direct contact.

73
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:48,610
So you don’t get nervous
unless it's direct contact.

74
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,030
No, I was nervous.

75
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:54,866
Do you know how nervous I was?

76
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,576
I’ve been nervous since last night.

77
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:01,081
Hae-hyo is a good guy.

78
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,083
I approve of your choice.

79
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:14,594
How old are you?

80
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:18,932
Is it rude for me to ask that?

81
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:23,979
I’m 26. We’re the same age.

82
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,816
No wonder I felt like we could be friends.
We’re the same age.

83
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,610
Should we speak casually, then?

84
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:32,612
Sure.

85
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:39,494
I need to get back in now.

86
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,709
But why did you come here?

87
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:47,585
Were you looking for me?

88
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,342
What happened earlier wasn’t fair.

89
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:57,971
You didn't steal her client,
but she misread the situation.

90
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:01,933
Yes, it was totally unfair.

91
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:04,644
I know how that feels.

92
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:15,113
You don’t have to look at me like that.

93
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:19,492
But why did you use that photo
as your wallpaper? I’m in it, too.

94
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:21,953
That’s confusing, you know.

95
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:32,714
<i>I clearly realized today
why I am a fan of Sa Hye-jun</i>

96
00:06:33,256 --> 00:06:34,716
<i>out of all the celebrities.</i>

97
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,179
<i>He has a special ability
to connect with people.</i>

RECORD OF YOUTH

00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:50,774
EPISODE 2

100
00:08:43,052 --> 00:08:44,554
-Good work.
-Good work.

101
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:47,307
Hey.

102
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,226
I took a million photos today.
How many do you think I can use?

103
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,853
It’s up to your photography skill.

104
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:54,022
Why would he say it like that?

105
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:56,441
Hey, you are bad at this, too.
Let's see who wins.

106
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:57,901
-I'll win.
-I'll win.

107
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:59,027
-Jinx.
-Jinx!

108
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,695
Buttercup!

109
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:02,530
You still act like elementary school kids.

110
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:03,948
We did meet in elementary school.

111
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:06,367
-But I met you in kindergarten.
-Fine. Good for you.

112
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:07,660
I'll remove your makeup. Sit.

113
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:10,038
Okay. I’m sorry.
You should be getting off work.

114
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,414
It’s okay.

115
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,750
Give me the cleanser. I’ll do it.

116
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,002
-Why are you speaking casually to her?
-Say hi, guys.

117
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:17,962
We’re friends now.

118
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:20,089
I’m Kim Jin-u.

119
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,091
You’re so sociable.

120
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,219
Don’t you ever get shy?

121
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,553
No, never.

122
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:27,680
-What’s your name?
-It's An Jeong-ha.

123
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:29,516
"An Jeong-ha"? You want to be stable?

124
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,934
You have a fun name.

125
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:32,477
"Won Hae-hyo"? What do you want?

126
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,686
You have a fun name too.

127
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:39,234
You’re in! She’s one of us.
Let's be good friends, Jeong-ha.

128
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:43,905
All right. Let’s go and have
a meal with our new friend.

129
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:47,408
We're up against Japan today.
We can eat while watching the game.

130
00:09:47,492 --> 00:09:50,370
-I'm buying with the money I earned today.
-Did they already pay you?

131
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:52,705
They will. I’m using it in advance.

132
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:54,374
That's so you.

133
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:56,709
I have something to take care of.
Decide where we’re going.

134
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,294
Where are you going?

135
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:07,679
Great job. The space you have here…

136
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:14,269
-is to my liking.
-Thank you.

137
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:17,480
I'm sorry to interrupt.

138
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:20,692
-Can you spare me a moment?
-What?

139
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,236
Okay. Can you wait for me over there?

140
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:26,573
No, you guys talk. I’m done here.

141
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:34,831
What’s this about?

142
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:37,709
Can you pay me directly for today’s show?

143
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,460
That’s a hassle. Why?

144
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:43,589
-Did you end it with your agency?
-Yes. Pay me fast.

145
00:10:43,673 --> 00:10:44,882
You got it, punk.

146
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:52,390
Hye-jun.

147
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,480
Don’t you have anything to tell me?

148
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:13,870
<i>I heard this car
goes up to 374 horsepower at max.</i>

149
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:17,832
It can reach 100km per hour
in just 4,6 seconds.

150
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,877
You must drive faster
with a car like this.

151
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,504
No. I should be on the Autobahn, then.

152
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:40,438
Do you want to drive?

153
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,065
Sounds great.

154
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:55,555
Isn’t this your first time here?

155
00:12:57,473 --> 00:12:58,516
Yes, it is.

156
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:06,524
Aren't you hungry?

157
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:09,068
I am.

158
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,072
Let's have a simple, delightful meal.

159
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:19,537
It's scallop, your favorite.

160
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:22,915
I like everything on this table.

161
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,209
-Can I eat it?
-Sure.

162
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:36,637
You can open the wine bottle.

163
00:13:43,644 --> 00:13:45,188
When are the others coming?

164
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:48,816
No one is coming.

165
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,445
You know how this industry works.

166
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:55,072
That's how they all start.
They have sponsors.

167
00:13:57,325 --> 00:13:58,326
Sir.

168
00:13:59,452 --> 00:14:01,788
-I respect you.
-Respect is a form of love.

169
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:03,206
But sponsorship is a business.

170
00:14:07,877 --> 00:14:09,086
I'm sorry I lied to you.

171
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:13,716
I thought you wouldn't come
if I told you it would be just you and me.

172
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:17,303
My love for you is too big

173
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:19,764
that I was even willing
to deceive you like this.

174
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:26,479
It's not about money.
The first time I set my eyes on you--

175
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:27,980
I think you should stop here.

176
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:33,861
Let me finish.

177
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:44,038
I don't want to stop
now that I developed feelings for you.

178
00:14:44,872 --> 00:14:46,624
I won't stop even if you turn me down.

179
00:14:57,468 --> 00:14:59,178
I don't want to hurt you, sir.

180
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,705
If you need to talk to me, go ahead.

181
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:47,685
You’re so cold.
That’s what makes you hot, though.

182
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:53,441
-Do you need money?
-I always need money.

183
00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:56,193
If you listened to me five years ago,
you wouldn’t be

184
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:57,904
where you are now.

185
00:15:57,987 --> 00:15:59,822
I don't hate the life I have now

186
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:01,782
although I'm not thrilled about it.

187
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:07,538
I’ll be your agent.

188
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:10,666
If you want to be an actor,

189
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,169
I can sponsor you
until you become an actor.

190
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:16,797
I'm sorry.

191
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:22,970
This is your last chance.

192
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:27,516
I’ll give you a week to think it over.

193
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:40,363
Are you okay?

194
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:43,324
I told you I’d do it.

195
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,662
I should at least be able to do
one-third of it, if not half.

196
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:48,788
I’m a burden to you.

197
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:50,873
No, you’re not a burden to me.

198
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:54,752
To be honest, I’m partially responsible
for your shoulder injury, too.

199
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:57,088
I know you don’t talk about it,
but I know.

200
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,845
It looked like your shoulder was doing
okay for a while. Are you stressed out?

201
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:07,556
Hye-jun got the draft notice.

202
00:17:08,057 --> 00:17:10,059
It would’ve been better
if he'd already done it.

203
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:11,394
Once he comes back, he’ll be 30.

204
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,271
I can’t get any sleep because of him.

205
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:16,399
Jin-u isn’t exactly doing better, either.

206
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,902
That’s it. Go home.

207
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:22,446
I won’t be able to focus with you here.

208
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:25,700
Then let's split the pay
by three to seven.

209
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:27,702
I’m the boss here. I’ll take care of it.

210
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,704
Go to the hospital.

211
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:32,081
Don’t just put on pain relief patches.
Okay?

212
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,250
Okay, I got it.

213
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:41,799
Do you like it?

214
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:44,552
Your son sent the flowers
to make you feel better,

215
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:46,012
so I tried my best.

216
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:47,930
How beautiful.

217
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:50,266
You’re so good with your hands.

218
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:53,644
I even won an award
at a drawing contest in middle school,

219
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:57,523
but nothing came of it since my mother
passed away when I was young.

220
00:17:57,606 --> 00:18:00,401
It’s better for children
when their mothers live long.

221
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:04,321
-You should live a long life, ma’am.
-Hey, that’s a curse.

222
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:07,533
-I’m going out.
-Okay.

223
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:18,878
This is great.

224
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:21,255
GYEONG-MI

225
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:28,054
-Hey.
-<i>Ae-suk, Yeong-nam went to the hospital.</i>

226
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:29,597
<i>His shoulder must've acted up again.</i>

227
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:31,640
That darned shoulder!

228
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,226
Then, Jang-man must be doing all the work.

229
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,937
He must have been stressed out
because of Hye-jun.

230
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:38,731
<i>I heard he’s going to
the military this time.</i>

231
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:41,567
We don't know yet.
He auditioned for a role.

232
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,569
If he gets it, he’ll postpone it again.

233
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:44,570
I hope he gets it.

234
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:46,822
<i>If he goes now,
his career would be halted.</i>

235
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:49,366
<i>And all of his efforts would
come to nothing.</i>

236
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,701
Hopefully, it will work out.

237
00:18:50,785 --> 00:18:53,037
You don't sound interested at all.

238
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,164
Hae-hyo's mom has been helping him
with his career,

239
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:56,457
<i>so he even filmed a commercial.</i>

240
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,751
He got it because he's good.

241
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,295
Gosh. You're so naive.

242
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:04,840
He must build his career on his own
to protect it.

243
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:07,927
It must be hard for Hye-jun.

244
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,887
<i>No one in his family is helping him.</i>

245
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,056
All right. Let's start our class now.

246
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:14,558
Ae-suk, I must go.
It's time for me to dance.

247
00:19:17,144 --> 00:19:19,563
Lucky you. You have time for dance.

248
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:31,325
Gosh, this is good.

249
00:19:31,408 --> 00:19:33,244
She's my daughter-in-law and all,

250
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:35,621
but she’s too good for my son.

251
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,627
It’s so nice to stay at home.

252
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,838
I would have to pay for everything
if I go out.

253
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:05,860
You were home.

254
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:07,862
Yes. I like home-cooked meals.

255
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:10,406
I thought you liked dancing.

256
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,201
If you didn’t eat yet,
sit down and join me.

257
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:15,786
I’m good.

258
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:19,373
Does your shoulder hurt again?
Did you go to the hospital?

259
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:20,708
Hospitals aren't free.

260
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,668
Health is more important than money.

261
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:25,379
I’m going to die in the end.
Why is that so important?

262
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:28,299
Not everyone is
awfully health-conscious like you.

263
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:30,426
If I get sick,
it will only make things worse for you.

264
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:31,677
This is the least I can do.

265
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:34,388
You’re a smooth talker, aren’t you?

266
00:20:35,222 --> 00:20:37,766
Why don’t you be one, too? Seriously.

267
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:40,186
The way he talks to me

268
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:43,314
makes me want to steal his food
and throw it out.

269
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:50,237
RECYCLING BIN

270
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,250
Father will like this.

271
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:07,421
Is there a men’s jacket?

272
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:09,173
He needs a jacket to go to work.

273
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:13,761
This will fit.

274
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:17,806
But if I say I bought it,
he won’t believe me.

275
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,017
And I'm sure he won't wear it
if I tell him the truth.

276
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:23,896
He doesn’t deserve this.

277
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:31,570
My goodness.

278
00:21:33,113 --> 00:21:33,989
Damn it.

279
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:37,743
Dad.

280
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:41,163
What is it?

281
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:44,959
Do you need help with the patch?

282
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:49,296
It’s turning into a chronic condition.

283
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,674
Will you be able to work?

284
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:53,968
I work because I have to,
not because my body can take it.

285
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:56,011
You just wait.

286
00:21:56,095 --> 00:22:00,349
When I win the lottery,
you won’t have to work.

287
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:02,476
You always hope to get lucky.

288
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,144
That’s why you’re living like this.

289
00:22:04,728 --> 00:22:07,106
You always lecture me
whenever you get a chance.

290
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:09,692
Do you think
I have nothing to say to that?

291
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:12,152
Yes. That's why you’re not saying
anything back. I know you.

292
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:14,071
Don’t say something like that to Hye-jun.

293
00:22:14,154 --> 00:22:15,656
How can you call your son a burden?

294
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:17,491
I was there to stop you last night,

295
00:22:17,574 --> 00:22:20,160
but you’re not supposed to say something
like that to your son.

296
00:22:20,244 --> 00:22:21,537
Words have power.

297
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,330
Did you think I wanted to say that to him?

298
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:26,417
You never took care of your child.
All you did was go out and play.

299
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,168
You wouldn’t know how to take care of one.

300
00:22:29,044 --> 00:22:31,463
You’re too aggressive.

301
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:32,798
You’re almost 60 now.

302
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:35,009
Instead of embracing my mistakes,

303
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:37,845
all you ever do is criticize me
at every chance you get. Seriously?

304
00:22:37,928 --> 00:22:41,265
That's why you’d never get lucky.
Got that?

305
00:22:41,348 --> 00:22:43,017
You can put it on yourself.

306
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,476
How dare you talk to me that way?

307
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:48,897
You could just put it on before you go.
Come on.

308
00:22:53,777 --> 00:22:55,571
No one can understand me.

309
00:22:56,572 --> 00:23:00,951
Starting off on the wrong foot
can ruin you completely!

310
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:03,579
How could you not know that
when you have experienced it firsthand?

311
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:17,634
Look at me.

312
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:20,262
I’m not stubborn like you.

313
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:23,223
I realized my mistake
and came back right away.

314
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:25,726
People must accept their mistakes
to have a successful life.

315
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:29,354
If anyone is going to lecture me,
he should at least have a successful life.

316
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:31,106
Someone with a failed life like you--

317
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:35,778
Hey, forget about the patches.
Let’s go to the hospital.

318
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:38,989
I don’t care about the cost. It can’t be
more important than your health.

319
00:23:39,073 --> 00:23:41,950
This is why
you’ve been poor all your life.

320
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,955
Unlike you,
I won’t be a burden to my children.

321
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:05,057
Where is everyone?

322
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:06,892
Outside.

323
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:09,561
-Why are you still here?
-I still have work left.

324
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:11,396
Why didn’t you say that earlier?

325
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:14,983
Then, I would have ruined the mood.
I’m a nobody.

326
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:16,860
That's not true.

327
00:24:18,362 --> 00:24:19,696
Are you going back to the salon?

328
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,283
No, I do free makeup lessons
on the street in my free time.

329
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:25,285
You’re so diligent.

330
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:27,454
Usually, my fans are diligent.

331
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:29,832
Your fans are pretty good.

332
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,877
Seeing how you're quick to agree,
you're his fan.

333
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:38,590
I see you're still close with him. You’ve
been friends since elementary school.

334
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:40,300
Isn’t it hard to stay friends that long?

335
00:24:40,384 --> 00:24:43,262
You know that we’ve been friends
since elementary school?

336
00:24:43,345 --> 00:24:45,848
You live in the same district,
but different neighborhoods.

337
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:50,936
You said you’re Hae-hyo’s fan.
Did you look into me too?

338
00:24:56,483 --> 00:24:57,776
You don’t want to answer that?

339
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:00,487
Right. I’m a nobody.

340
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:02,406
That's not true!

341
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:04,992
Why are you yelling at me?

342
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:07,244
That makes me almost believe
that I'm a nobody.

343
00:25:08,412 --> 00:25:10,497
Right. Why did I yell?

344
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:13,750
Why are you asking me that?
It was you who yelled.

345
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:16,920
I wasn't asking you why.
I was talking to myself.

346
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,964
But think about it.

347
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:22,551
You say something like that
when you are belittling yourself.

348
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:24,553
I don't want anyone to say that.

349
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:27,514
That's why I was strongly
showing you my disapproval.

350
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,516
You said it first.

351
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,352
I was just responding to what you said,
so you don't feel bad.

352
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:37,191
You can't stand being unfairly treated.

353
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:38,442
How did you know?

354
00:25:38,525 --> 00:25:40,235
I just found out when you corrected me.

355
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,195
Thanks.

356
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,897
FOLLOWERS, 553K

357
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:48,733
He has 553,000 followers.

358
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:54,155
If I could,
I want to buy 10,000 followers,

359
00:25:54,948 --> 00:25:56,950
but he’s not on any projects.
It'll look suspicious.

360
00:25:58,118 --> 00:26:01,580
I'll hike it up when the articles
about the movie get published.

361
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:03,373
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS

362
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:08,545
FEE: 1,357,000 WON FOR 3,670 FOLLOWERS

363
00:26:08,628 --> 00:26:10,297
YOUR PAYMENT IS BEING PROCESSED

364
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,381
PAYMENT SUCCESSFUL

365
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:14,301
You’ve been lounging around
now that your exams are over.

366
00:26:14,384 --> 00:26:16,511
I told you to stop eating chips.
You’ll get fat.

367
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:17,470
Sure.

368
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:20,390
You have a knack for torturing people.

369
00:26:21,308 --> 00:26:22,225
What are you up to?

370
00:26:23,143 --> 00:26:24,352
Nothing.

371
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:25,937
If it's nothing, why did you close it?

372
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:31,026
-Is it…
-What?

373
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:34,905
I heard having a boy toy is trending
among housewives in Gangnam.

374
00:26:34,988 --> 00:26:36,406
Watch your language.

375
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:40,827
Your father can be boring,
but I’m very ethical.

376
00:26:40,911 --> 00:26:42,370
Whatever.

377
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:45,081
-Should I set up a blind date for you?
-That’s so lame.

378
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:47,083
Then, find a guy
when you go to law school.

379
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:49,753
-I’ll handle it.
-Suit yourself.

380
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,297
But you can’t just marry whoever you want.

381
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,007
Everyone in the family must approve.

382
00:26:54,591 --> 00:26:56,551
I shouldn’t talk to you
for more than ten minutes.

383
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:58,011
My stress level is rising.

384
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:00,680
I’m going to a department store.

385
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:03,767
I saw a cute pair of sneakers from Chanel.

386
00:27:04,726 --> 00:27:06,186
Are we leaving now?

387
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,397
I'm the one who'll stay by your side
no matter what.

388
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:10,982
You’re a smart girl, so I’ll stop here.

389
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:13,193
Is that how you want to get away
with your favoritism?

390
00:27:13,276 --> 00:27:15,028
You're all about him.

391
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:16,780
All I get from you is
some expensive stuff.

392
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:20,033
You just wait. Once I'm done
with Hae-hyo, you're next.

393
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:24,829
-Aren’t we going to the department store?
-I have to change.

394
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:35,882
You’re shaking your leg,
so something must be up.

395
00:27:36,716 --> 00:27:37,717
What is it?

396
00:27:38,885 --> 00:27:41,221
-I got the role in the movie.
-Tell him.

397
00:27:41,805 --> 00:27:43,640
If you don’t,
he will keep waiting to hear back.

398
00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:45,475
It’s not that easy.

399
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:48,144
He said he'll join the military
if he's not cast.

400
00:27:49,688 --> 00:27:52,941
Seriously. When I asked him to serve
in the military with me, he said no.

401
00:27:53,024 --> 00:27:55,276
He was preparing for a show
with Gucci, so he couldn't.

402
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,320
Should we tell him to call the studio?

403
00:27:57,404 --> 00:27:58,530
They are closed today.

404
00:28:01,449 --> 00:28:03,410
-You should tell him.
-No, I can’t do that.

405
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:06,913
I didn’t get the role.
It’s best to hear it from you.

406
00:28:06,997 --> 00:28:09,582
-Then, what do I do?
-Tell him when he’s in a good mood.

407
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:11,376
I don't know when he'll be in a good mood.

408
00:28:18,383 --> 00:28:22,137
Hey, the match against Japan.
What if we win the soccer match?

409
00:28:23,054 --> 00:28:24,681
-That's awesome.
-Yes.

410
00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:25,807
Nice.

411
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,644
Hey.

412
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:34,274
Now, give it back.

413
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:36,401
I’ll carry it to the bus stop. It’s heavy.

414
00:28:36,484 --> 00:28:38,153
It’s fine. I carry this all the time.

415
00:28:39,988 --> 00:28:41,573
You’re so independent.

416
00:28:42,157 --> 00:28:43,199
I have no one to rely on.

417
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,494
That's a surprise.

418
00:28:46,578 --> 00:28:49,414
I thought you grew up comfortably
because you said you were Hae-hyo’s fan.

419
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:51,041
Why is that?

420
00:28:51,124 --> 00:28:53,668
Aren’t you drawn to people
who are similar to you?

421
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:54,919
Well, that’s the case with me.

422
00:28:56,129 --> 00:28:56,963
Are you coming?

423
00:28:57,964 --> 00:28:59,215
I’m coming!

424
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:01,968
See you later then.

425
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:04,304
Later? There’s no later.

426
00:29:04,387 --> 00:29:06,181
That kind of empty formality isn’t nice.

427
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,895
Give me your cell phone.

428
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,030
Come to our salon.
I’ll give you a celebrity discount.

429
00:29:22,113 --> 00:29:23,948
You’re such a cool fan.

430
00:29:24,616 --> 00:29:26,993
Usually, other fans would skip work
and follow him.

431
00:29:27,077 --> 00:29:28,995
Then, my routine would be ruined.

432
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:32,832
I should have a stable life myself
before I support someone.

433
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,335
Is that how you got your name?

434
00:29:35,418 --> 00:29:36,878
No, it's because I never decide on things.

435
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:39,506
-You don't let anything slide.
-If I do, it becomes a habit,

436
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:40,673
so I don’t.

437
00:29:40,757 --> 00:29:42,926
It sounds like you always win.

438
00:29:43,468 --> 00:29:44,511
I've been losing.

439
00:29:45,095 --> 00:29:47,305
After I quit my office job,
I've been losing a lot.

440
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:51,059
So are you venting about that on me
when we are total strangers?

441
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:53,395
You're brutally honest.

442
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:55,563
People do say I'm straightforward.

443
00:29:56,147 --> 00:29:59,275
SA HYE-JUN

444
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:03,530
<i>He's not what I had pictured in mind.</i>

445
00:30:05,907 --> 00:30:08,243
-Why are you staring at me?
-Just because.

446
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:10,787
-Until when will you stare at me?
-Until you leave.

447
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:14,290
Then, I should go.
Your stare is uncomfortable.

448
00:30:20,046 --> 00:30:24,217
I was talking to a guy, but why does it
feel like I was talking to a doll?

449
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,678
-What should we get?
-Did you wait long?

450
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:28,304
-Yes, very long.
-I'm sorry.

451
00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:32,934
Jeong-ha, get a grip.

452
00:30:33,643 --> 00:30:35,228
Now, he's real.

453
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:41,234
Are you still reading that?

454
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:42,777
I asked my friends,

455
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,113
but they said the contract period
is too long.

456
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:46,281
Then, don’t sign it.

457
00:30:47,449 --> 00:30:49,576
How can I work with you
if you don’t trust me?

458
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:51,661
Do you know

459
00:30:51,744 --> 00:30:54,080
how much money and time
I have to invest to help a rookie?

460
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:57,667
But my friends said if my cut is only
30 percent, it’s not a good deal for me.

461
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,253
Who are your friends? Seriously.

462
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:04,674
Kids these days are
so calculative and materialistic,

463
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:06,301
but you’ve got no grit.

464
00:31:06,384 --> 00:31:08,344
How can you succeed with that attitude?

465
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:09,762
CONTRACT

466
00:31:09,846 --> 00:31:12,807
I’m kind of indecisive.
I’ll think about it again.

467
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:16,394
You definitely need me.

468
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:19,647
How could you survive in this industry
when you’re that indecisive?

469
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,566
Others will definitely deceive you.

470
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:24,986
My mom said I’m not even
good enough to get conned.

471
00:31:26,988 --> 00:31:29,449
-Bye.
-Fine. Leave now.

472
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,622
Who is that? Did you sign that model?

473
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:38,750
Why would I sign with that loser?

474
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:40,835
-Why are you here?
-Why do you think?

475
00:31:41,544 --> 00:31:43,129
I came here to check if you paid Hye-jun.

476
00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:47,217
What’s up with me lately?
Only weirdos are coming my way.

477
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:49,260
Should I proceed with plan B?

478
00:31:49,344 --> 00:31:51,804
Don’t you know anything about Hye-jun?

479
00:31:53,348 --> 00:31:55,725
Do you think he’d ever be a burden to you?

480
00:31:57,685 --> 00:32:00,355
And you still stole
from such a nice kid like him?

481
00:32:00,438 --> 00:32:02,690
I’m trying to make ends meet,
so that's what I did.

482
00:32:03,358 --> 00:32:05,193
He won’t survive. He’s too soft.

483
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:08,530
He’s too innocent
to be in this kind of industry.

484
00:32:09,364 --> 00:32:10,907
That’s the casting director from Dalman.

485
00:32:11,574 --> 00:32:13,701
They want Hye-jun
for this season’s fashion show.

486
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:16,162
-That’s great.
-So do you know what I said?

487
00:32:17,497 --> 00:32:19,415
I told them that he retired.

488
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:20,667
Hello.

489
00:32:30,927 --> 00:32:31,886
Father.

490
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:35,265
You’re late. That's not your usual route.

491
00:32:35,974 --> 00:32:37,100
I went grocery shopping.

492
00:32:37,183 --> 00:32:39,519
I’m cooking pollack soup.
It’s Yeong-nam’s favorite.

493
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:40,853
Find anything good?

494
00:32:40,937 --> 00:32:43,356
I found a great suit for you.

495
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,567
-I’ll get it dry-cleaned.
-Anything for Yeong-nam?

496
00:32:47,402 --> 00:32:49,320
I found a jacket,
but I bet he won’t wear it.

497
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:52,282
I’ll wear it first and give it to him.
I’ll say I bought it.

498
00:32:53,032 --> 00:32:55,994
Father, you’re so smart.

499
00:32:57,078 --> 00:32:59,956
When I hit the lottery,
I’ll buy you a house.

500
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:03,334
Thank you, Father.

501
00:33:03,418 --> 00:33:07,297
No, I should thank you
for accepting such a lousy hope.

502
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,716
I could never hate you.

503
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:12,760
There hasn’t been a single woman
who hated me.

504
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:16,848
I hope Yeong-nam would express
half of what you express.

505
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:20,226
Okay. Let's go inside. Let's go.

506
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:38,328
Goodness.

507
00:33:46,252 --> 00:33:47,462
What time is it?

508
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:51,674
If you’re in pain,
please go to the hospital.

509
00:33:51,758 --> 00:33:54,260
The doctors don’t do anything.

510
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:57,472
Do you know how expensive a shot is?

511
00:33:58,556 --> 00:34:00,683
Getting proper treatment is cheaper
than taking medicine

512
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:02,852
and putting on relief patches.

513
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:04,437
I’ll pay the medical bill.

514
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:07,023
Stop acting so pathetic over money.

515
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:08,232
Pathetic?

516
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:11,110
How could you say that to me?

517
00:34:11,194 --> 00:34:13,655
You’re the one who should know
when to shut your mouth.

518
00:34:13,738 --> 00:34:16,449
I know Jang-man is a close friend,
but don’t talk about our kids.

519
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:18,159
He’ll find out anyway.

520
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:20,620
When Hye-jun comes home,
I’ll put an end to this.

521
00:34:20,703 --> 00:34:23,706
Starring in a movie won’t change his life.

522
00:34:24,415 --> 00:34:26,459
-Who knows?
-I’ll eat my hat if that happens.

523
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:29,170
Stop encouraging him
and don’t say anything.

-Yes.

<i>That was so close.</i>

00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:52,003
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

541
00:35:53,254 --> 00:35:54,338
Hello.

542
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:56,758
I don’t wear makeup.

543
00:35:56,841 --> 00:36:00,803
But when the fine dust level is high,
my skin feels a bit itchy and dirty.

544
00:36:01,512 --> 00:36:03,973
There’s a way you can block out
fine dust particles with makeup.

545
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:06,017
I’m filming a video right now.

546
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,227
If you don’t mind being on camera,
I can teach you.

547
00:36:08,895 --> 00:36:11,063
I’m bad with my hands.
Do you think I can do it?

548
00:36:13,191 --> 00:36:15,401
-Hello.
-Hi.

549
00:36:15,485 --> 00:36:19,280
I'll show you how you can block out
fine dust particles with makeup.

550
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:21,908
Your skin tone…
Let me check your skin first.

551
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:27,747
Son Heung-min must be over the moon today.

552
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,332
He deserves to skip his military duty!

553
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:32,084
He only has good days coming for him.
Good for him.

554
00:36:32,585 --> 00:36:33,628
Good for him.

555
00:36:33,711 --> 00:36:35,922
Isn’t that such an honor as a man?

556
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:39,217
The real honor should go to young men
who dedicated two years of their lives

557
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,843
to protect our country like me.

558
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:43,262
Have you had chicken
for all three meals in one day?

559
00:36:43,346 --> 00:36:45,973
-When avian flu breaks out--
-<i>Samgyetang</i> for breakfast.

560
00:36:46,057 --> 00:36:48,059
Braised chicken for lunch.
Fried chicken for dinner.

561
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:50,269
-What about swine fever?
-Spicy pork for breakfast.

562
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:52,897
Braised pork ribs for lunch.
Pork belly for dinner.

563
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,273
-I'll throw up.
-I'll throw up.

564
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,653
Hey, you experienced
the military indirectly through me.

565
00:36:58,736 --> 00:37:01,197
I’m sure you’ll adapt well over there
even if you go now.

566
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:03,282
Am I going to the military now?

567
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:14,043
The movie studio called.

568
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:16,963
I didn’t know how to bring this up,

569
00:37:17,505 --> 00:37:19,090
but it’s better to get it over with.

570
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:21,926
You’re so cruel!

571
00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:25,429
Did you have to tell me that now?

572
00:37:34,313 --> 00:37:36,524
-You jerk. Why did you do that?
-You told me to do it.

573
00:37:36,607 --> 00:37:38,609
-How can you do it now?
-It was your advice.

574
00:37:41,946 --> 00:37:43,656
-Hye-jun.
-Hye-jun.

00:38:18,524 --> 00:38:22,278
<i>My life is in between</i>

00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:25,865
<i>Jobless twenty-somethings are

<i>Follow your dream like breaker</i>

580
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,874
Stop pitying yourself.

581
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:38,753
Stop it. I've had enough of this.

582
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:43,758
You guys ruined my precious moment.

583
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:50,973
I don’t get a lot of chances to be happy,
worry-free.

584
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:54,769
He told me that telling you
when you’re in a good mood was the best.

585
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,274
Did you really have to tell on me?

586
00:39:12,745 --> 00:39:14,413
I like the stories of BTS songs.

587
00:39:15,206 --> 00:39:17,750
When I listen to their songs,
it makes me want to live a good life.

588
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:21,420
Hey, guys. You guys can live those lives.

589
00:39:21,504 --> 00:39:23,756
Of course, that probably won't happen.

590
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:27,218
Why don't you finish him?

591
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:30,179
-Just crush him. Do it.
-It hurts.

592
00:39:30,262 --> 00:39:31,722
-You're crushing him.
-Hey.

593
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:33,975
-You jerk.
-I crush him, and he crushes me.

594
00:39:34,558 --> 00:39:35,851
Do you want to do it, too?

595
00:39:35,935 --> 00:39:38,521
<i>All right. When you contour
your face like this,</i>

596
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:40,147
<i>your facial features stand out.</i>

597
00:39:40,231 --> 00:39:43,067
<i>And as for this T zone,</i>

598
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,069
use a highlighter.

599
00:39:46,028 --> 00:39:47,571
I bet you have a boyfriend.

600
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,826
<i>I don’t date since dating requires
a lot of emotions and affects my life.</i>

601
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:53,369
<i>But I’m a fangirl.</i>

602
00:39:53,452 --> 00:39:55,121
<i>Who is it? Let me join you.</i>

603
00:39:55,204 --> 00:39:56,622
<i>I’ve been on a break from that.</i>

604
00:39:57,498 --> 00:40:00,459
It’s a secret.
But I met him this afternoon.

605
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:02,044
No way.

606
00:40:07,758 --> 00:40:09,218
Do you need me to comfort you?

607
00:40:10,094 --> 00:40:11,595
That was enough.

608
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:14,473
I know for a fact you'll make it.

609
00:40:14,557 --> 00:40:16,225
I’m not saying this
because I'm your friend.

610
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:18,853
You know how objective I am, right?

611
00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:21,939
-Let’s go home silently.
-Sure.

612
00:40:23,065 --> 00:40:25,735
When you have a lot on your mind,
silence is the best companion.

613
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:29,905
Perfect timing.
If this is a girl, I’ll marry her.

614
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:34,493
<i>Let's eat</i> ramyeon.

615
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,122
-Are you getting married?
-You're crazy.

616
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:44,420
I’ve got to go.

617
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:48,174
Don’t think about anything.
Just for today. Bye.

618
00:41:18,788 --> 00:41:20,456
<i>You ought to think about your life.</i>

619
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:23,000
What did I tell you five years ago?

620
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:25,044
I said you wouldn’t make it on your own.

621
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:31,759
If I can’t do it on my own, I should quit.

622
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,305
<i>Why aren’t you ambitious?</i>

623
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:38,933
<i>Do you want to just die a nameless model?</i>

624
00:41:43,437 --> 00:41:44,563
Screw you.

625
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:09,588
He’s here.

626
00:42:15,386 --> 00:42:17,680
You drank a lot.
Did you go to an after-party?

627
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:20,182
I didn’t go there.
I drank with Jin-u and Hye-jun. I’m tired.

628
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,686
It’s a good day.

629
00:42:23,769 --> 00:42:25,312
Why the long face?

630
00:42:25,896 --> 00:42:28,440
Mom. Do you know anyone
at the movie studio?

631
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:31,819
How would I know people from there?

632
00:42:32,611 --> 00:42:33,654
Why are you asking?

633
00:42:33,737 --> 00:42:35,364
They may have a different role
for Hye-jun.

634
00:42:35,865 --> 00:42:37,783
Is this about Hye-jun again?

635
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:40,411
Is he your brother?
Why are you so eager to help him?

636
00:42:40,494 --> 00:42:41,871
I won’t help even if I can.

637
00:42:41,954 --> 00:42:44,582
Fine. Forget I said anything.

638
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:47,918
-Is Dad home?
-He's sleeping.

639
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:51,088
I was so happy and waited for you,
so we could celebrate with a drink.

640
00:42:51,172 --> 00:42:52,631
But this is disappointing.

641
00:42:53,132 --> 00:42:56,719
It sounds like
you still want to have a drink with me.

642
00:42:56,802 --> 00:42:58,137
But I’m going to bed.

643
00:43:01,432 --> 00:43:02,433
Hey!

644
00:43:09,315 --> 00:43:11,025
You don’t seem bothered at all.

645
00:43:11,984 --> 00:43:14,820
Whenever I think about his school,
I'm still furious.

646
00:43:15,654 --> 00:43:17,156
What are you still furious about?

647
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:20,242
You startled me.
I thought you were sleeping.

648
00:43:23,913 --> 00:43:26,540
I must have had too much caffeine
for the day.

649
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:29,460
I told you I wanted to send Hae-hyo
to a private elementary school,

650
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:31,545
but you sent him to a public school.

651
00:43:31,629 --> 00:43:34,256
Look at his friend. He’s best friends
with the housekeeper's son.

652
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,718
Men ought to experience people
from various economic classes.

653
00:43:37,801 --> 00:43:40,638
Sticking to just one class will
narrow down his perspective.

654
00:43:41,222 --> 00:43:44,516
Stop with your Confucian ideas.
Birds of a feather flock together.

655
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:48,270
Hye-jun is going to be a roadblock
to Hae-hyo one day.

656
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:51,440
He should be dancing and celebrating
because he got the role,

657
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:53,817
but he can’t enjoy it because of Hye-jun.

658
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:55,361
Why must he go through that?

659
00:43:55,444 --> 00:43:57,363
That’s just his hobby. He’ll quit later.

660
00:43:57,446 --> 00:43:59,073
Why are you getting so worked up?

661
00:43:59,156 --> 00:44:00,491
Who says this is his hobby?

662
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:04,161
Taking over the school will be his hobby.
Being a celebrity will be his main job.

663
00:44:04,787 --> 00:44:07,331
By the way, you’re slacking off lately.

664
00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:08,999
You've been dropping honorifics.

665
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:11,710
How many times did I tell you couples
must be polite to each other?

666
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:14,088
That's so vulgar.

667
00:44:14,713 --> 00:44:17,675
People tell me that they are envious of me

668
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:18,884
because I have everything.

669
00:44:19,468 --> 00:44:21,178
But they have no idea

670
00:44:21,845 --> 00:44:25,933
how painful it is to live with a husband
whom you can’t communicate with.

671
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:27,768
Goodness.

672
00:44:58,007 --> 00:45:01,677
Hey, I want to do <i>Arena</i>'s
photoshoot with Hye-jun.

673
00:45:02,261 --> 00:45:03,887
They want you.

674
00:45:04,555 --> 00:45:06,015
They won't like it if Hye-jun joins.

675
00:45:06,098 --> 00:45:07,808
Then, tell them I won’t do it.

676
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:10,394
This photoshoot is for rookie actors
who used to be models.

677
00:45:10,477 --> 00:45:11,895
I’ll cover all the additional costs.

678
00:45:11,979 --> 00:45:13,272
<i>All right. I’ll talk to them.</i>

679
00:45:13,355 --> 00:45:15,816
By the way,
you got more followers on Instagram.

680
00:45:15,899 --> 00:45:16,984
Let’s hit one million!

681
00:45:21,488 --> 00:45:22,906
FOLLOWERS, 557K

682
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,117
I got 3,000 more followers in a day.

HOW TO DO FINE DUST-FREE MAKEUP

684
00:45:45,137 --> 00:45:46,138
Today was a perfect day.

685
00:45:50,017 --> 00:45:51,810
I should record a day like this.

686
00:45:58,692 --> 00:45:59,526
All right.

687
00:46:00,652 --> 00:46:04,698
Today was a perfect day.

688
00:46:07,451 --> 00:46:09,578
Mr. Won Hae-hyo, this way.

689
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:10,704
Okay.

690
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,794
-It was exciting.
-So you always do this.

691
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:18,420
You always try to steal clients.

692
00:46:20,631 --> 00:46:21,632
It was unfair.

693
00:46:21,715 --> 00:46:24,051
We're the same age.
Should we speak casually, then?

694
00:46:24,134 --> 00:46:25,052
Sure.

695
00:46:28,847 --> 00:46:31,391
-It was surprising.
-What happened earlier wasn’t fair.

696
00:46:31,475 --> 00:46:33,769
You didn't steal her client,
but she misread the situation.

697
00:46:33,852 --> 00:46:35,104
I know how that feels.

698
00:46:37,106 --> 00:46:38,690
It was touching.

699
00:46:38,774 --> 00:46:40,109
People do say I'm straightforward.

700
00:46:41,193 --> 00:46:42,277
And it got real.

701
00:46:53,038 --> 00:46:55,415
#A PERFECT DAY #EXCITING
#UNFAIR #SURPRISING #TOUCHING

702
00:46:58,627 --> 00:47:01,588
You have so many problems.

703
00:47:01,672 --> 00:47:04,842
You said you were sick.
Why are you doing that now?

704
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:07,261
He got a job.
I can’t afford to buy him a new house,

705
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:08,595
but I should install a new door.

706
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,266
It’s nice and sturdy. You know?

707
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:14,893
Gyeong-jun’s life should be
just like this door.

708
00:47:14,977 --> 00:47:17,896
When I get paid this month,
I’ll buy you a present.

709
00:47:19,857 --> 00:47:21,108
What about me?

710
00:47:22,151 --> 00:47:23,569
Of course, you get one, too.

711
00:47:24,153 --> 00:47:26,029
-Really?
-Let's go to sleep. Stop.

712
00:47:27,114 --> 00:47:28,115
Thank you.

713
00:47:28,198 --> 00:47:31,743
My goodness. Gyeong-jun is the best.

714
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:33,620
No, I'm not.

715
00:47:40,544 --> 00:47:42,629
How pathetic.

716
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,227
Do you think
you should be drinking right now?

717
00:48:00,147 --> 00:48:02,608
Just let it go today.

718
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:05,652
How will you survive in this world
if you’re that weak?

719
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:07,654
I don’t need your input.

720
00:48:07,738 --> 00:48:09,531
My life is miserable enough. Stop it.

721
00:48:10,073 --> 00:48:11,241
When I was your age,

722
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:14,244
I worked at construction sites
to feed my family.

723
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:17,164
You just need to take care of yourself.
How can you say you have it bad?

724
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:21,126
If I tell you,

725
00:48:22,419 --> 00:48:24,004
will you understand me?

726
00:48:24,087 --> 00:48:25,881
When have I not been understanding?

727
00:48:30,677 --> 00:48:31,803
I didn’t get the role.

728
00:48:34,097 --> 00:48:37,476
Good! Now, you can go to the military.

729
00:48:38,352 --> 00:48:40,187
You end up in the military anyway.

730
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,064
Look at me. I went to the military first.

731
00:48:42,147 --> 00:48:43,690
Poor people like us

732
00:48:43,774 --> 00:48:45,901
should get it done as fast as possible.

733
00:48:45,984 --> 00:48:47,402
Stop bragging about yourself now.

734
00:48:47,486 --> 00:48:51,406
He wouldn’t have said that
if your brother wasn’t worried about you.

735
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:54,076
The military duty is like homework.
We all have to go at one point.

736
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:56,995
But until I finish that homework,
it will be on my mind.

737
00:48:57,537 --> 00:48:58,872
Who do you think it'd bother more?

738
00:48:59,706 --> 00:49:01,959
It’s my life. Wouldn’t it bother me
more than you guys?

739
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:03,919
I didn’t tell you to become a model.

740
00:49:04,002 --> 00:49:06,088
When you were trying to become a model,

741
00:49:06,171 --> 00:49:08,799
he got into Seoul National University
without having a private tutor.

742
00:49:08,882 --> 00:49:12,010
Your brother did it
even without any help from us.

743
00:49:12,094 --> 00:49:14,763
Studying is the easiest thing
in the world.

744
00:49:14,846 --> 00:49:17,099
I started working way before he did

745
00:49:17,182 --> 00:49:19,101
-and became a top model.
-But no one on the street

746
00:49:19,685 --> 00:49:21,395
will recognize this top model.

747
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,231
What?

748
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:27,651
That’s the end of your luck.

749
00:49:27,734 --> 00:49:29,695
Just come back to your place
and face reality.

750
00:49:29,778 --> 00:49:31,613
You’ve been working for seven years,

751
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:34,032
but how much money did you save up?

752
00:49:34,116 --> 00:49:36,034
You and I have to make a living
for ourselves.

753
00:49:36,118 --> 00:49:38,203
I won’t sacrifice myself
because I'm the eldest

754
00:49:38,745 --> 00:49:40,747
-of this poor family.
-I don’t care if we’re poor.

755
00:49:42,332 --> 00:49:44,126
But must you criticize me like this?

756
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:46,628
People chew me out.
I get chewed out even more at home.

757
00:49:46,712 --> 00:49:49,047
You said you’re my family.
You want the best for me.

758
00:49:49,131 --> 00:49:51,591
-Family can’t solve everything.
-Then,

759
00:49:53,427 --> 00:49:55,178
don’t tell me what to do with my life.

760
00:49:57,806 --> 00:50:01,059
I have never asked for money from you
after I graduated high school.

761
00:50:01,893 --> 00:50:04,813
Why are you looking down on me
with your assumptions for my future?

762
00:50:04,896 --> 00:50:06,481
Are you playing the victim right now?

763
00:50:06,982 --> 00:50:09,985
If you think I’m playing the victim here,
you’re a psychopath.

764
00:50:10,068 --> 00:50:11,486
When I said I didn’t get the role,

765
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,739
wouldn’t normal people try to comfort me

766
00:50:13,822 --> 00:50:15,365
and see my pain?

767
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:16,950
"Good. Go to the military now."

768
00:50:17,034 --> 00:50:19,244
-No human would say that!
-How dare you?

769
00:50:20,078 --> 00:50:22,122
Are you saying that I'm no human?

770
00:50:22,205 --> 00:50:24,499
You ungrateful child.
How dare you say that to your parents?

771
00:50:26,084 --> 00:50:28,086
Hey. If he’s an ungrateful child,

772
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:30,380
you’re just the same
given how you treat me.

773
00:50:30,464 --> 00:50:32,466
Why are you making this worse, Father?

774
00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:34,509
Why do you always pick on Hye-jun?

775
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:37,888
He didn’t get the role,
so he can’t do what he loves to do.

776
00:50:37,971 --> 00:50:40,432
How could you say those things?
You should comfort him first.

777
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:43,352
-Unbelievable.
-Grandpa, if you butt in like this,

778
00:50:43,435 --> 00:50:44,853
Dad can’t discipline him properly.

779
00:50:44,936 --> 00:50:46,938
Hey, Hye-jun is 26 now.

780
00:50:47,022 --> 00:50:48,982
Back in my day,
he’d be old enough to marry.

781
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:51,109
He’s living his own life.
You don’t need to teach him.

782
00:50:51,193 --> 00:50:52,486
Grandpa, let’s go inside.

783
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,654
Yes, let’s go to our room.

784
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:58,283
They deserve each other.

785
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:01,620
Look at this shabby door.

786
00:51:02,204 --> 00:51:05,040
You installed a new door
for his bright future.

787
00:51:05,123 --> 00:51:08,377
But do you want us to live a shabby life
with this shabby door?

788
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,129
If you were fixing his door,
you should have fixed both doors

789
00:51:11,213 --> 00:51:13,048
or shouldn’t have done it at all.

790
00:51:13,131 --> 00:51:14,424
You always play favorites.

791
00:51:23,934 --> 00:51:26,144
What's wrong with this door?

792
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:28,522
That wasn't me.

793
00:51:42,897 --> 00:51:44,732
I only caused trouble.

794
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:47,814
I'm sorry for inconveniencing you.

795
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:10,628
Thank you for taking my side.

796
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:16,134
Your dad is going to kill me tomorrow.

797
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:20,096
I’m the cause. So I’ll handle it.

798
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:22,557
People don’t change.

799
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:26,894
I always caused trouble,

800
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,440
and your grandma always took care of it.

801
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,820
I like you because you’re honest.

802
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:38,781
What did you do today?

803
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,784
-Did you go dancing?
-No.

804
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,539
I’m sick of it now. I want to make money.

805
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:50,960
You couldn’t do that when you were young.
How can you do that now?

806
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:55,047
If you mean that,

807
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:57,508
you’re just like your dad.

808
00:52:58,801 --> 00:52:59,844
Sorry.

809
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:04,140
I just meant you should have fun
with the money I give you.

810
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,641
How could I do that?

811
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,769
You worked hard to earn it.

812
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,148
Can you get a job for me?

813
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,819
You know a lot of people
and go to a lot of places.

814
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,574
Okay. I’ll look into that.

815
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:27,455
I want to give some money to your dad.

816
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,710
He came home early today
because of his shoulder.

817
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,882
He won’t go to the hospital

818
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,927
to save money.

819
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:44,138
Gosh, it’s so upsetting.

820
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:58,236
Don’t cry.

821
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:00,821
Okay.

822
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:10,873
Why are you crying?

823
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,201
SA YEONG-NAM

824
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,834
<i>I have never had a room for myself.</i>

825
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:01,173
<i>At this moment,</i>

826
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,552
<i>I needed a room to cry out by myself
without worrying about my family.</i>

827
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:57,605
<i>Having my own room and my house…</i>

828
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:02,234
<i>I dreamed of having my own house
by doing something I liked.</i>

829
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:08,491
<i>I will reject the reality</i>

830
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,702
<i>that won’t give me what I want.</i>

831
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:39,939
-Where are you going?
-On a trip. I’ll travel around Namhae.

832
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,025
Before I go, I have great news for you,
so I came here in person.

833
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,736
-Make it quick. I have to go somewhere.
-I can't.

834
00:56:49,704 --> 00:56:52,331
Hey, Daniel. It's me.

835
00:56:52,415 --> 00:56:53,875
How are you?

836
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:56,377
Yeah. Hye-jun can work for you

837
00:56:58,004 --> 00:57:00,882
Quit? No. He did okay.

838
00:57:00,965 --> 00:57:03,009
He just switched agencies.

839
00:57:04,844 --> 00:57:06,262
Which agency?

840
00:57:09,432 --> 00:57:10,475
My own.

841
00:57:11,726 --> 00:57:15,563
So from now on,
you just need to contact me.

842
00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:19,942
I started my own company.

843
00:57:23,321 --> 00:57:24,405
The name?

844
00:57:26,574 --> 00:57:30,828
My company name is…

845
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:34,827
JJamppong.

846
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:37,913
Yes, it's called JJamppong.

847
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:40,750
"JJamppong"?
<i>Jjajangmyeon</i> is better than <i>jjamppong</i>.

848
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:43,461
-<i>Jjamppong</i> is better than <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.
-I feel bad, though.

849
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:45,880
I can’t go.

850
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,798
-Why not?
-I can’t afford a plane ticket.

851
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:51,635
I would need a place to stay, too.
I can’t do it alone. It’s in three days.

852
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:53,888
I would have to get on the plane today.
It’s impossible.

853
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,056
-Hey.
-Thanks, Min-jae

854
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,641
for going out of your way for me.

855
00:57:57,725 --> 00:58:01,896
Hey, it was so hard to book this.
I can’t cancel this.

856
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,314
So why did you lie?

857
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:04,482
Eyes on the road.

858
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,108
Be careful. Gosh.

859
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:09,403
I need to serve in the military
at the beck and call of our country.

860
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,740
Military? When are you going?

861
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:17,036
Next month. That will be
my turning point. I’m quitting.

862
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:19,079
Drop me off over there.

863
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:21,624
Okay.

864
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:28,422
Have fun. When you come back,
I’ll buy you something delicious.

865
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:31,008
Hye-jun. Hye-jun, wait.

866
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:36,305
Damn it.

867
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:11,048
-I didn't expect to see you soon.
-I cannot accept your offer.

868
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:17,471
You don't like to beat around the bush.
You got to the point.

869
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:19,265
I respected and admired you.

870
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:21,767
Thank you for the offer.

871
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:30,985
Okay, if that's what you want,
I understand.

872
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:35,155
-Let's have lunch together.
-I have plans.

873
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:39,660
You're very busy.

874
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:42,538
I guess you easily spare your time
for other people.

875
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:45,374
Or did you make up plans
that you didn't even have?

876
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:50,629
I lied.

877
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:57,344
-I don't think I can have lunch with you.
-Why is it so complicated?

878
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:01,015
Do you think you're that important?

879
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:03,559
Am I a joke to you?

880
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:06,937
Is it because I'm being nice to you
after you rejected me?

881
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,107
You’re so dense.

882
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:13,903
You can’t succeed
with that brain of yours.

883
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:16,780
That’s why you’re still at the bottom.

884
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:20,826
If criticizing me makes you feel better,
go ahead.

885
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:22,661
This crossed my mind when I looked at you.

886
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,706
There’s a reason you’re not successful.

887
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,585
Look at Hae-hyo now.
You two started out together.

888
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:33,881
Since he has support,
things are working out for him.

889
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:37,051
You’ll probably die

890
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,804
at some construction site
just like your father.

891
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:49,813
Remember today.

892
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:54,526
I was polite to you to the end.

893
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:18,759
What…

894
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:23,013
Gosh, it hurts. It hurts.

895
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,935
Why aren't you on your trip?

896
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:31,188
I did something crazy, Hye-jun.

897
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:39,196
Min-jae, people can make mistakes
when they are cornered.

898
01:01:39,822 --> 01:01:41,573
If you apologize,
I’m sure they'll understand.

899
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:47,246
I used to book all the tickets
at the agency.

900
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,748
This is a piece of cake.
I even booked a place for you to stay.

901
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,377
-Am I going to France, too?
-A direct flight to Milan costs twice.

902
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:56,130
-We'll land in Milan via France.
-Min-jae.

903
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,965
If you have plans, cancel.
It leaves at six.

904
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,466
Go home and get your passport.

905
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,551
I can’t tell them

906
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:02,594
JJamppong was made up!

907
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,307
But…

908
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:13,522
What kind of brushes do we need?

909
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:15,733
We need shading, blush
and foundation brushes.

910
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,777
It’s like you had the answer ready.

911
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,071
I always know
what we have in the inventory.

912
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,615
You know, Jeong-ha?

913
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,702
I could never like you.

914
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:28,579
If you don’t like me, then don’t like me.

915
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,750
I wasn’t going to say this
because it’s childish.

916
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,501
Then, it’s better that you don’t say it.

917
01:02:34,585 --> 01:02:35,669
Hey!

918
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:40,716
Control your feelings. Think about
how you’ll affect your juniors.

919
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,969
I’m a good judge of character, indeed.

920
01:02:44,053 --> 01:02:46,305
Now, you’re showing me your true colors.

921
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:49,683
Why? Did something happen
when you had a meal with Hae-hyo?

922
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,478
How could you not invite me?
I was there, too.

923
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:55,564
I didn’t go. I had other things to do.

924
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,401
How could I not invite you?

925
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:03,822
I shouldn’t hear that from you after you
humiliated me in front of other people.

926
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:09,328
Everyone has a bitchy side.

927
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,456
You’re not the only one with that.

928
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:23,842
That hit the spot!

929
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:26,553
I won’t hide now.
You might get caught in the crossfire.

930
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:29,139
I just focus on you,
so it’s comfortable for me.

931
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:32,810
How was meeting Sa Hye-jun?

932
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:34,728
I told him to come to our salon.

933
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,856
I hope he does.
And he can bring Won Hae-hyo.

934
01:03:38,607 --> 01:03:41,819
If Hae-hyo comes,
Jin-ju will bully me even more.

935
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,862
I hope he doesn’t come.

936
01:03:43,946 --> 01:03:45,739
“Hae-hyo”?

937
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,408
You only met him once.
Are you trying to brag?

938
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:50,661
You must get to know someone
over a long time.

939
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:52,955
You're pretending to be his friend!

940
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,457
I'm not pretending. We became friends.

941
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:56,792
No way.

942
01:03:57,334 --> 01:04:00,420
It’s all thanks to Hye-jun.

943
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,404
You look like
it’s your first time on a plane.

944
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:27,322
It is my first time.

945
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,328
You have a knack for surprising people.

946
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:37,916
I never had a chance to live for myself.

947
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,711
I think this fashion show is for you,
not me.

948
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:44,506
-Orange juice, please.
-Okay.

949
01:04:45,716 --> 01:04:47,384
-Water, please.
-Okay.

950
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:49,761
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

951
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:52,639
It's good.

952
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:41,350
If we were in Korea, we could’ve drunk
at the convenience store.

953
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:44,144
We’ve been here only for two days,
but it feels like it’s been a month.

954
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:48,398
It must be boring for you
if you feel it’s been that long.

955
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:51,485
It’s like I'm dreaming.

956
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,780
I don’t have to worry
about making ends meet

957
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:56,406
and want you to do well on the stage.

958
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,992
And when you did well,
it made me happy, too.

959
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:04,664
What is this feeling? It’s flustering.

960
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,169
You feel that way when you’re in love.

961
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:14,424
I must be in love.

962
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,472
-Not with you. With this process.
-Okay.

963
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:25,435
Helping people succeed
and stuff like that.

964
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:27,562
So I told you to be my agent.

965
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:32,901
Do you really want to quit?

966
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:37,989
I don’t want to, but it's only logical.

967
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:41,076
Why did you decide that?

968
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:45,038
I didn’t get the role in the movie.

969
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:46,915
I really wanted to work
with that director.

970
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,251
It was my last chance.

971
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:51,753
-Then, who got the role?
-Hae-hyo.

972
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:55,340
Hey. No. That’s not right.

973
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:58,093
I know both you and Hae-hyo.

974
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:00,011
Of course, he’s great,

975
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:03,432
but you’re special.

976
01:09:04,975 --> 01:09:06,518
You can move people’s hearts.

977
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:08,437
You even moved mine.

978
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,148
It’s all over, anyway. Cheers!

979
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:21,283
I love it.

980
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:33,420
Why did you sleep on the plane?

981
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,630
-Was it delicious?
-Totally.

982
01:09:35,714 --> 01:09:38,133
-You slept, so you didn't get to eat.
-What did they serve?

983
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:39,676
Bibimbap.

984
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:48,435
-Hello, Min-jae.
-It’s been a while.

985
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:51,938
Congratulations on getting the role.

986
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:54,483
Thank you. I’ll take Hye-jun now.

987
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:56,151
Do you want us to drop you off somewhere?

988
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:58,737
No. There’s a direct bus from here.

989
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,072
Are you heading to the hair salon?

990
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:03,325
Yes. He’s been pestering me
to change the salon.

991
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:04,576
You won’t regret it.

992
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:08,288
All right, guys. I'm off now. Bye.

993
01:10:08,872 --> 01:10:10,040
Thank you.

994
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:11,374
-See you.
-Bye.

995
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:14,419
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

996
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:20,383
Before you go, I’ll write down
the brand and color of the foundation.

997
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:21,468
Okay.

998
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:27,599
-Hello.
-Hello, welcome.

999
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:29,559
I heard a lot about you from your mother.

1000
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:31,603
You should have come sooner.

1001
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,105
I strongly recommended coming here.

1002
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:35,023
Thank you.

1003
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,691
I'm friends with Jeong-ha.

1004
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:40,111
I didn't know
you were a friend of Jeong-ha.

1005
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:42,239
And his friend is my friend as well.

1006
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:53,750
My gosh, this is nice.

1007
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,544
You said you’d give us a discount.

1008
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:57,963
You guys look so close.

1009
01:10:58,046 --> 01:10:59,506
Did you meet before the fashion show?

1010
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,925
No. She’s really friendly.
And she’s your fan.

1011
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,969
What? Really?

1012
01:11:04,052 --> 01:11:06,221
Why didn’t you tell me that before?
Are you my fan?

1013
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:08,557
-No.
-It's okay. You can tell him.

1014
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,393
-You're so shy.
-And you have a big mouth.

1015
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:13,436
That was a bit harsh.

1016
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,815
Are we close enough
to exchange such remarks?

1017
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:22,696
Sorry.

1018
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:26,992
Hey, she seems flustered.
Don't make a joke sound so serious.

1019
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:30,287
My acting has been improving lately.
Did I get you?

1020
01:11:30,996 --> 01:11:32,455
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm sorry.

1021
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:37,711
What's so funny? Let me join you guys.

1022
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,212
Let's go. I know a lot of jokes.

1023
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:41,756
-Ask Jeong-ha to take care of you.
-I want my hair washed.

1024
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:43,758
Come this way.

1025
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:50,599
Sit here. Someone will be here.

1026
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:53,893
Don't feel uncomfortable around me.

1027
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:56,354
You don’t need to be careful around me
because you're my fan.

1028
01:11:58,398 --> 01:12:00,150
I’m really not your fan.

1029
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:03,320
Why do you keep saying that?
It’s embarrassing me.

1030
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:05,113
This is so frustrating.

1031
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:08,450
Why can’t you say
that you’re my fan when you are?

1032
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:09,492
I’m Hye-jun’s fan.

1033
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:12,370
-What?
-I couldn’t tell him the truth

1034
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:13,913
because I was embarrassed.
You saw it, too.

1035
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:16,458
-You weren't embarrassed in front of me?
-No.

1036
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:19,169
-You're funny.
-Don’t tell Hye-jun.

1037
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:20,253
Why must I do that?

1038
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:21,838
You’re Won Hae-hyo.

1039
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:25,467
“Won Hae-hyo is warmhearted and kind.

1040
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,177
Models who know him said…"

1041
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,430
Okay, stop it. Did you look into me, too?

1042
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:32,849
"…he does a lot of favors
as he’s softhearted.”

1043
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:34,851
Okay. Fine.

1044
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:36,853
Wait here.

1045
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,365
-Where are you going?
-To the restroom.

1046
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:49,699
I see. It's that way.

1047
01:12:51,326 --> 01:12:53,244
Are you happy to see Hae-hyo?

1048
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:56,247
Please don’t butt in my business.

1049
01:12:57,457 --> 01:12:59,167
Can you do other stuff than makeup?

1050
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,753
Yes. I can kind of do everything
that requires hands.

1051
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:03,546
Can you cut hair?

1052
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,048
I can use hair clippers

1053
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,258
for soldiers
and kids under seven years old.

1054
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:10,845
The photoshoot is in two days.
You should come then.

1055
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:12,889
-It’s a photoshoot for <i>Arena</i>, right?
-Yes.

1056
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,392
You should beat Jin-ju.

1057
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:17,268
You should beat her at least once.

1058
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:20,980
If you lose even with my help,

1059
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:23,775
you’re a fool.

1060
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:29,906
He must think
I've been losing all the time.

1061
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,325
I'll win this time.

1062
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,881
Good. Try to look livelier.

1063
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,219
<i>I couldn't explain it.</i>

1064
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:53,596
<i>But deep down in my heart,
I felt something rising up.</i>

1065
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,932
<i>I figured out what it was.</i>

1066
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:59,811
<i>You and I shine in our own way.</i>

1067
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:01,688
Do you know why you didn’t get the role?

1068
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:05,483
The director liked you at first,

1069
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:08,987
but Hae-hyo has more followers than you.
So they went with him.

1070
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,407
You lost because of popularity,
not because of your acting.

1071
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:22,250
<i>I fooled myself that not comparing myself
and competing against him was virtuous.</i>

1072
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:25,837
<i>Now, I have no regrets.</i>

1073
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,684
Are you done?

1074
01:14:40,185 --> 01:14:42,771
What? So you don’t even call
before you come now?

1075
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:44,397
I need to do something.

1076
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:46,691
Right here?

1077
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:50,153
Can you cut my hair with the hair clipper?

1078
01:14:51,196 --> 01:14:53,782
Do you want to go back
when you were seven years old?

1079
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:56,826
I’m joining the military.

1080

RECORD OF YOUTH

1082
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:03,643
-Have you ever been on a date?
-Of course I have.

1083
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:07,772
Do you think I enjoy going off at Hye-jun?

1084
01:16:07,856 --> 01:16:09,983
Hey. Aren't you even going to greet me?

1085
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,442
You saw me too.

1086
01:16:11,526 --> 01:16:13,236
What am I going to do
when you join the military?

1087
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,572
-I'm going to miss you.
-Just wait 18 months.

1088
01:16:15,655 --> 01:16:18,116
You must be upset because of Hye-jun.
If he joins the military,

1089
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:19,742
his career will be over.

1090
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,286
<i>It was just a phase.</i>

1091
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:23,496
<i>Don't give up until
you exhaust all the possibilities.</i>

1092
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:26,666
<i>Success is doing what you like and eating
delicious food. There's nothing to it.</i>

1093
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,918
<i>I just want to be a humble star.</i>
